- [19 Mar 2021 7:13am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/): Bond movie no. 4: Thunderball (1965). This is the first one I didn&rsquo;t like very much. Too many boring/confusing underwater parts. There&rsquo;s a jetpack! Wasn&rsquo;t there an atomic bomb aboard that boat when it exploded? And did they just leave the guy who helped Domino escape floating alone in the ocean?
- [18 Mar 2021 8:43am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1372468780039688193/): @paulcatiang might be a while before I consider the other books in the trilogy haha
- [18 Mar 2021 2:54am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1372380839728713730/): Huh, just found out someone with a nontrivial following on PH twitter has blocked me. Not anyone I know personally and not anyone I remember getting into any argument with, but still curious as I find myself largely inoffensive lol. Still, achievement unlocked I guess?
- [17 Mar 2021 4:27pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1372223129209208838/): Star Trek episode where a magician named Robert Angier accidentally time travels to the Enterprise in the 23rd century. When Scotty explains the transporter to him, he weeps.
- [16 Mar 2021 2:28pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/gr4j6py/): Oh wow, when people joke about not having seen the homepage, I thought they meant the logged in home page with the Top Questions list. I really have never seen this before!
