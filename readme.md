- [26 Mar 2021 4:10am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/gs98o1v/): So what does that mean? Are we never getting iOS/Android versions in SEA? Will they (Tencent) release it later? Or there&rsquo;s no word at all?
- [26 Mar 2021 3:02am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/mdf9dp/): Posted on r/magicTCG: Android/iOS versions not available in Southeast Asia? Has anyone in SEA been able to get the mobile versions? I&rsquo;m from the Philippines, me and my friend in Singapore both can&rsquo;t find the app on the stores. Even when using a direct link, the stores will just say Arena isn&rsquo;t available in the country/region. Any others from SEA countries have any luck?
Have they released any official word on this?

- [25 Mar 2021 3:42pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375110861237325824/): So @MTG_Arena why isn&rsquo;t your iOS app available in my region? #mtgarena

Cringe at trying to pass Bond off as Japanese. Introduction of secret volcano lair trope. Ninjas with guns! First screen appearance of the head of SPECTRE, inspiration for Dr Evil.
 That endgame scene of ninjas invading the secret volcano lair reminded me of the Simpsons episode You Only Move Twice. Bond&rsquo;s &ldquo;wife&rdquo; never named despite being only Bond girl to survive the movie.
