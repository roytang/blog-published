- [21 Jan 2021 3:43pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352280628490747906/): Platforms should not be responsible for a person making awful content. They are absolutely responsible when they put it in front of people who didnâ€™t even know it existed. They should know the difference between hosting awful content and choosing to broadcast it. We all should.
- [21 Jan 2021 9:19am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352184058369871874/): @rom thank you!
- [21 Jan 2021 9:17am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352183495053852672/): @rom what device is that?
- [21 Jan 2021 6:15am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352137686614564867/): 2021 movie no. 3: World War Z (2013). Pretty typical action movie I think, entertaining enough. Should have watched at the start of the pandemic.
- [21 Jan 2021 3:04am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352089564244938754/): I see some people posting like &ldquo;why are you all excited about biden, the US is still going to be imperialist/not progressive enough/whatever&rdquo; and i&rsquo;m like ugh sure whatever, lots of room for improvement still, but did you actually prefer trump?
The US just kicked out a racist, misogynistic, egocentric sociopath president, let them enjoy that for a little bit maybe? There&rsquo;s no shortage of people willing to push their admin for reforms either.
