Looks like my internet isn&rsquo;t very good for streaming tonight though =/
Managed to play 2 drafts, but both had terrible outcomes. I did take local recordings, but I&rsquo;m not gonna bother uploading lol

Quoted ZaidJilani&#39;s tweet:   Just a private company, controlling chokepoints of vital information and shutting them down when they&rsquo;re trying to intimidate a country&rsquo;s government.  
- [18 Feb 2021 9:07am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1362327948783575041/): ATTACK AND DETHRONE CAPITALISM
Quoted westonpagano&#39;s tweet:   let’s check in on how America/capitalism is handling the latest crisis  
- [18 Feb 2021 8:58am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1362325561754808322/): @ChelDiokno Sir, hindi po ba pwedeng kasuhan ng cyberlibel ang mga ganyan
- [17 Feb 2021 11:57pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1362189435815698433/): Our internet service has thankfully been restored, now I no longer have any excuse for not being productive.
I am once again living in a society
