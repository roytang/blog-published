The Duterte govt gave us no choice. Those who still get vaccinated with sinovac should even be commended for setting aside their misgivings

Moore feels a lot more &ldquo;generic white guy&rdquo; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&rsquo;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&rsquo;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.

Quoted rodelalbert&#39;s tweet:   I saw an acquaintance on ig who recently posted he got vaccinated and I asked if he was in the group A category. Turns out nasa friends of the VIP category pala sya.
