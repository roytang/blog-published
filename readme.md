- [8 Jan 2021 7:47pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347631047215702016/): I have yet to see any Valki Vartokamus jokes and I am disappointed in all of you #mtg #MTGKaldheim
Quoted SaffronOlive&#39;s tweet:   Geez, god/planeswalker MDFC. At first glance it seems really solid. Valki is good early, Tibalt gives you late game utility.  
- [8 Jan 2021 7:37pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347628452577304576/): If this isn&rsquo;t some allegory for what we face as a country, IDK what is
Quoted PhilippineStar&#39;s tweet:   The Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) on Friday announced the passing of Philippine Eagle Pag-asa, the icon of conservation efforts in the country.  
- [8 Jan 2021 7:31pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347626957047877632/): I wonder if the US cop procedurals (NCIS, etc) have started putting white supremacists/altright nazis/homegrown terrorists into their regular rotation of villains
- [8 Jan 2021 10:23am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347488989385613312/): So far the only thing we can be sure about in the Dacera case is how incompetent our cops are. So, nothing new.
- [8 Jan 2021 10:16am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347487434125111297/): @wrongwaygoback happy birthday!
