- [24 Oct 2020 12:15am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/): Despite not having played Eternal since before the pandemic, after reading this tweet from LSV, I signed up for the event he described and got the 7 wins and qualified for the LCQ in the first try. I used Skelle&rsquo;s decklist from here: https://direwolfdigital.com/news/throne-summer-championship-decklists/
I&rsquo;m having fun!
Quoted lsv&#39;s tweet:   This is the perfect time to get into Eternal - you can try any deck you want, you&rsquo;ve got a high-stakes tournament to play in, and there are lots of resources in the article for decklists, strategy guides, and more.

On the internet, we should avoid Facebook to protect others.

Here in the Philippines, Marcos&rsquo; children have risen the ranks in local politics unrepentant of and despite their father&rsquo;s infamy, on the back of patronage and propaganda
Quoted JessicaValenti&#39;s tweet:   One day Ivanka will try to separate herself from her father in an attempt to reenter polite society. There will be a tearful confession, a book deal, or a glossy PR campaign.
- [23 Oct 2020 10:44am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/g9qvnxs/): The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.
- [23 Oct 2020 9:24am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319570275986452480/): 10/23 Friday afternoon Zendikar Rising draft! ep9 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgznr #twitch
Draft no. 11 went reasonably well, although I realized later that I didn&rsquo;t get a full art land for this one, apparently the promo had already ended. Will still play one more draft next week in this series to wrap it up, I guess.
