I got the lantern again, but this draft didn&rsquo;t go as well as the last one. Might have needed more lands.

Not just on social media, FB, Twitter, whatever. Write on your own sites and blogs. On your tumblrs, wordpresses, whatever. Long-form, rambling, incessant. The world could use more sincere blogging.

Wasn&rsquo;t able to screencap the results, but this draft went quite well! Tergrid&rsquo;s Lantern is definitely a bomb, and even the squirrel overperformed I think.
