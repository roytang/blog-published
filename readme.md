- [18 Mar 2021 2:54am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1372380839728713730/): Huh, just found out someone with a nontrivial following on PH twitter has blocked me.

- [17 Mar 2021 4:27pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1372223129209208838/): Star Trek episode where a magician named Robert Angier accidentally time travels to the Enterprise in the 23rd century. When Scotty explains the transporter to him, he weeps.
