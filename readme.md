- [23 May 2021 5:27am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1396336876928126980/): the first thing our new hire did was fix a bug that&rsquo;s been bugging him forever as a user prior to joining.
he then breathed a sigh of relief and submitted his two weeks&rsquo; notice. wtf??

I actually started checking this because this reddit thread claimed that if your win% is at least 56% then the upcoming draft challenge should be profitable, so I just miss that threshold lol. Area for improvement!

Some friends tried to tell me not to waste my time, but joke&rsquo;s on them I enjoyed it anyway! In hindsight, the plot was pretty flimsy, but I enjoyed the fights. It&rsquo;s basically what you&rsquo;d expect lol.
