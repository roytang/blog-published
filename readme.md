- [13 Jan 2021 11:45am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349321771489447939/): @zaaaldehyde it&rsquo;s more like you learn to live with how your life turned out
- [13 Jan 2021 11:03am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/gj2o5nv/): Ah, that&rsquo;s good to know! Thanks
- [13 Jan 2021 6:44am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/kw2qun/): Posted on r/MagicArena: Foretell and Revealed Cards in Hand on Arena I&rsquo;m wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent&rsquo;s hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you&rsquo;re holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled.
