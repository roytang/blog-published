- [9 Apr 2021 12:19pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/): Bond movie no. 7: Diamonds are Forever (1971). Connery&rsquo;s hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I&rsquo;d expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O&rsquo;Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment.
 These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones.

Quoted migueldeicaza&#39;s tweet:   Signal, the private messaging tool, introduced a new payment system. A win-win for mobsters and the pump-and-dumpers behind this.
As usual, the people will loose, and they lost my trust. https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1379763470216888321
