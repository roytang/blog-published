Quoted ChefJags&#39;s tweet:   You can only retweet this if you know exactly how it feels to have this rig.
Your browser does not support the video tag.

Not with time, as they say, but with intention. So go. Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken world waits in darkness for the light that is you.&ldquo;&ndash; L. R. Knost

Looks like I&rsquo;m finally paying for all the good luck I had over the past few days; I did two drafts today and both of them were terrible!

It&rsquo;s annoying because he always shows up in my Google alerts lol
- [21 Apr 2021 11:57pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/mvsss1/): Posted on r/GlobalTalk: [Question] What are the police like in your country? If you&rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &ldquo;all cops are bastards&rdquo;)
In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.
