- [11 Mar 2021 11:29am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1369973843050164226/): A bit worse off, since we didn&rsquo;t have a pandemic in 1985 afaik.
Quoted LaTtEX&#39;s tweet:   Massacres openly conducted by the police and military. Opposition figures in jail. A dying but belligerent despot. Deputies jockeying for power. A crashed economy. Infrastructure projects burying us in decades of debt.

- [11 Mar 2021 9:14am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/): James Bond movie no. 2: To Russia With Love (1963). This one actually had more bits that felt like actual espionage. And Bond didn&rsquo;t need to get captured this time!
- [10 Mar 2021 1:20pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/gqfxqv1/): They should release the 3 Kaldra equipment into historic one at a time, one every three years or so
- [10 Mar 2021 8:04am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/951fcfe07a7cbb8d04ee6dd219c181fb/): Is there any good privacy respecting recaptcha alternative?
