Here in the Philippines, Marcos&rsquo; children have risen the ranks in local politics unrepentant of and despite their father&rsquo;s infamy, on the back of patronage and propaganda
Quoted JessicaValenti&#39;s tweet:   One day Ivanka will try to separate herself from her father in an attempt to reenter polite society. There will be a tearful confession, a book deal, or a glossy PR campaign.
- [23 Oct 2020 10:44am](https://roytang.net/2020/10/g9qvnxs/): The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.
- [23 Oct 2020 9:24am](https://roytang.net/2020/10/1319570275986452480/): 10/23 Friday afternoon Zendikar Rising draft! ep9 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgznr #twitch
Draft no. 11 went reasonably well, although I realized later that I didn&rsquo;t get a full art land for this one, apparently the promo had already ended. Will still play one more draft next week in this series to wrap it up, I guess.
