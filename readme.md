- [11 May 2021 12:00am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/current-status/): Summary:  Like every other sensible person in the pandemic, I am staying hunkered down at home all of the time. Really only going out to get groceries and meds. On a work hiatus, but open to interesting opportunities.  Current Location:  still living in Quezon City, Philippines.  Work  Currently on a work hiatus. But if you have something interesting, hit me up, maybe we&rsquo;ll get lucky.  How am I spending my time  I&rsquo;m working on multiple personal projects, most of which I don&rsquo;t want to talk about.

- [10 May 2021 9:50am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ba2999c2cc9d8803ad982d24e52035e6/): Bond movie no. 9: The Man With The Golden Gun (1974). Christopher Lee was a Bond villain! Beirut, Macau, Hong Kong, Bangkok. An Asian girl is introduced just for the pun in her name. Comic relief southern sheriff dude is back from the previous film. Final fight scene with Nick Nack was ridiculous. As per usual, Bond gets captured and the bad guy explains everything. Still not used to Roger Moore in the role.
- [6 May 2021 5:47pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1390362590501474304/): Every time I accidentally nap after dinner I have to pay for it by being unable to sleep until 3am then waking up late and missing my morning walk window D:
