- [17 Jan 2021 11:28am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350766994576982022/): @Westraid happy birthday!
- [16 Jan 2021 8:39am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350361902149324800/): 2021 #movies no 2: The Godfather part 2 (1974). This is two movies rolled into one. Still pretty good, but I think I liked the singular focus of the first one more.
- [15 Jan 2021 11:29am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350042544567029763/): 2021 movies no. 1: The Godfather (1972). Everyone is so young! Such a well-told gangster tale. Looking forward to the sequel
