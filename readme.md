This season felt tighter than the first in terms of pacing and such.But I&rsquo;m not happy with the way it promotes American interventionism and their easy willingness to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign nation (however justified it may be)

Rare-drafted a bunch (I think 6 in the deck and 4 in the board), but still got a decent enough deck. Didn&rsquo;t perform well though, had some bad keeps

- [30 Apr 2021 1:07pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/183ab94b6cb10f5db0431e715cde1945/): Invincible season 1 finale was pretty great, the fight was intense and afterwards I couldn&rsquo;t believe there was still half an episode to go. It&rsquo;s been a while since I read the books so I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it&rsquo;s fine.The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!
- [30 Apr 2021 11:56am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1388100027684331520/): Phrases like &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;no proof&rdquo; does nothing to dissuade people whose arguments are along the lines of &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t hurt to try&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybe it will help&rdquo;.
Quoted reportrdotworld&#39;s tweet:   The DOH and FDA reminded the public that they do not recommend the use of Ivermectin to treat #COVID19 due to insufficient scientific evidence.
https://www.reportr.world/news/doh-fda-do-not-recommend-ivermectin-for-covid-a4736-20210430?utm_source=Twitter-reportr&amp;utm_medium=Ownshare&amp;utm_campaign=20210430-twnp-news-doh-fda-do-not-recommend-ivermectin-for-covid-a4736-20210430-twfirst
 The drug actively harming people would be more effective but the disadvantage of relying on science is that we can&rsquo;t just make claims like that without evidence.
