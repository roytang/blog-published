- [7 Feb 2021 10:48pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/146ce75d91951cde348df07bbf175ad4/): My computer greets me in the morning as it always has for the past few months: with &ldquo;Your dropbox is almost full&rdquo;.
- [7 Feb 2021 7:54pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/gmeu5pi/): “please respect my belief that your beliefs are bullshit”
- [7 Feb 2021 6:44am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1358305512517849089/): Sometimes I consider writing a regular newsletter about daily goings-on in the country, but I quickly realize I would quickly burn out on the sheer density of shenanigans our politicians/&ldquo;leaders&rdquo; get into. Probably not a job for a single person.
- [5 Feb 2021 11:19am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1357650153709142017/): Gonna draft some more Kaldheim, keep me company if you like: https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #kaldheim
I got the lantern again, but this draft didn&rsquo;t go as well as the last one. Might have needed more lands.
