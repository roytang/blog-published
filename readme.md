- [16 Feb 2021 11:15pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1361816433877917699/): Globe fiber&rsquo;s been down in the house since yesterday afternoon. On the bright side, I managed to finish a book and a game yesterday. Reading and playing, not writing and making, unfortunately.
It&rsquo;s Ash Wednesday, so I guess it&rsquo;s a bit of penitensya for me =/
Globe internet outage in tandang sora area into its 28th hour so far. @talk2GLOBE hasnt replied to me DMs in 10hrs. Internet service is crucial during the pandemic, so more responsive customer service would be nice
- [16 Feb 2021 8:22am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1361591861454852098/): @talk2GLOBE is there any fiber outage currently in tsora qc area?
- [16 Feb 2021 6:30am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1361563612385398785/): I feel like I&rsquo;ve seen this episode before

Ended up having to cut yesterday&rsquo;s stream short because of technical issues. Draft deck felt decent, though the run started poorly.
