Ended up with a 3 hour stream doing 1 sealed and 1 draft. Didn&rsquo;t finish too well, only went 4-3 in sealed with silverquill and 3-1 in draft with lorehold, but it&rsquo;s a decent enough start. I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses!

The Duterte govt gave us no choice. Those who still get vaccinated with sinovac should even be commended for setting aside their misgivings

Moore feels a lot more &ldquo;generic white guy&rdquo; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&rsquo;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&rsquo;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.
