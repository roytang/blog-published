[22:42] Tonight&rsquo;s extra long final AFR stream featured FOUR DRAFTS. Look at these piles and try to guess whether I made it out of Gold rank?

 great, fun, violent, hilarious, possibly best of DCEU so far trailers have spoiled waaaay too much of this movie first act was ok, second act felt a bit meh, third act was great    hard to comment on actor performances without spoiling things, but Daniela Melchior was great and Idris Elba took the role seriously there is a post-credits scene  Full review on the blog later
