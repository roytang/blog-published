- [24 Feb 2021 10:28pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/gomwdig/): It wasn&rsquo;t a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I&rsquo;m occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration.
I didn&rsquo;t have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight *one* guy (well, best of 3).
