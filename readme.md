- [28 Jan 2021 5:57am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1354670019045584899/): The whole Gamestop brouhaha reminds me of the explanation I made for stock market prices a while back on reddit&rsquo;s ELI5 forum: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c9plk/eli5_stock_prices_constantly_changing/dhtc9qo/?context=3
&ldquo;There is no magic formula that predicts what stock prices will be (whoever discovers that first will be rich). It&rsquo;s largely a matter of perception and psychology. Sometimes stock prices move mainly because of rumors or speculation.&rdquo; -&gt; basically everything&rsquo;s made up, lol
And if I may add, if this reddit thing ends up as a catalyst to topple/reform capitalism, unlikely as it may seem, I would find that hilarious

- [27 Jan 2021 7:13pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/gkxp5u8/): I followed the Sporza feed that was the result of pasting that url, and it looks like it&rsquo;s the correct one:

Rest assured, it gets better
