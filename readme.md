Welcome to the world HTML Pascual.
- [9 Jun 2021 10:33pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/h17mkgy/): Ah, excellent. Kahit yung 1 and 3 lang siguro. I&rsquo;ll DM you my email address. Thanks!
- [9 Jun 2021 12:19pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/nvukbz/): Posted on r/Philippines: I&rsquo;m looking for an old Pugad Baboy strip Baka merong may copy. In the strip, Patrolman Durugas has stopped Mang Dagul for a traffic violation, tapos pinilisopo sya ni Dagul, so binigyan sya ng ticket, nakasulat &ldquo;violation: pilosopo&rdquo;
I would guess it&rsquo;s from the early books, kasi I remember medyo raw pa yung art style. Probably somewhere in books 1-3, kasi I have book 4 here, parang mas polished na yung art.

Quoted peard33&#39;s tweet:   Apple said a new &ldquo;private relay&rdquo; feature designed to obscure users&rsquo; web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons. Same in Belarus, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the Philippines &amp; more. via @StephenNellis
