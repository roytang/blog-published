- [5 Jan 2021 10:01pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/gi6ha57/): I can’t relate to this request (I guess because I’m spiky), but I’m always curious whenever this comes up: are there other ccgs that do this (having systems that reward things other than winning, aside from daily quests)?
- [5 Jan 2021 12:40pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1346436487819116544/): Senate: We will investigate the PSG vaccination
Duterte:
Your browser does not support the video tag.  Quoted cnnphilippines&#39;s tweet:   Roque: The President said that he will invoke the executive privilege and forbid his security group from attending the Senate hearing, it&rsquo;s not really a gag order http://bit.ly/2KTomNC  
- [2 Jan 2021 10:58pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1345504732060663808/): PSA: if you keep your timeline in &ldquo;latest tweets&rdquo; mode (click sparkly blue icon on top right of app) you will have a chronological timeline and never have to see what your follows like. I always forget that&rsquo;s a thing since I never see it
Quoted daretorant&#39;s tweet:   I feel like folks don’t fully realize that liking a tweet puts it into their followers’ feeds (almost at the same rate that RTs do).
- [1 Jan 2021 12:10pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1344979283568050176/): It&rsquo;s Jan first, let&rsquo;s just restart all the habits and see which ones stick
- [31 Dec 2020 11:33pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344788913697669120/): Since I do Google Takeout on a regular basis, it would be nice if they had an option to generate a delta export since the last one, instead of making me download 100+ gigs everytime
