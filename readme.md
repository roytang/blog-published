- [25 Apr 2021 7:07am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1386215271027732481/): This is great
Quoted gothspiderbitch&#39;s tweet:   so did anyone else know that there was a massive pool noodle battle planned between all the people named Josh today that was ultimately won by a 5-year old named Josh who was crowned The Supreme Josh or was I just supposed to find this out on my own  
- [24 Apr 2021 5:36pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1386011173275922433/): It&rsquo;s actually amazing how computers have become exponentially more powerful in my lifetime (yet somehow our web browsers manage to eat up most of the memory)
Quoted ChefJags&#39;s tweet:   You can only retweet this if you know exactly how it feels to have this rig.
Your browser does not support the video tag.

Not with time, as they say, but with intention. So go. Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken world waits in darkness for the light that is you.&ldquo;&ndash; L. R. Knost

Looks like I&rsquo;m finally paying for all the good luck I had over the past few days; I did two drafts today and both of them were terrible!
