- [15 Apr 2021 4:54am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1382557908513161222/): Honestly I feel like people like this should be named and shamed publicly. If we can&rsquo;t catch them, we should at least make it socially unacceptable
Quoted rodelalbert&#39;s tweet:   I saw an acquaintance on ig who recently posted he got vaccinated and I asked if he was in the group A category. Turns out nasa friends of the VIP category pala sya.  
- [12 Apr 2021 11:21pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381749447424495619/): This was great but sometimes I wonder how people know to video something before knowing how it&rsquo;s gonna turn out
Quoted cheembeam&#39;s tweet:   The way I screamed after watching the end of this video! ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜‚

It&rsquo;s the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.
- [12 Apr 2021 7:27am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381509157480591362/): People need to learn to stop sending scanned documents sideways. Your scanner software has a setting for the document orientation!
- [12 Apr 2021 6:07am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381489041082736643/): Pwede ka sumingit sa pila. Pag may nagkwestyon sa yo sagutin mo ng &ldquo;that&rsquo;s an unchristian question&rdquo;
