- [1 Jun 2021 11:47am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1399693989582835713/): Cops should just be banned from drinking while carrying weapons. Or from drinking altogether maybe. Either way is fine. (Enforcement would be tough)
Quoted manilabulletin&#39;s tweet:   LOOK: A police officer lies dead after a fellow police shot him when the latter ‚Äúlost in an arm wrestling‚Äù during a drinking session in Quezon City, police bared Tuesday, citing narrative of a witness. (üì∏: QCPD-PIO) | via @mbseppedrajas  
- [28 May 2021 8:48am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1398199368465850375/): Does anyone actually have a good experience transacting on fb marketplace? My mom was complaining about an item listed as P50 but when she PMed the seller it was like 1000+. I told her to just avoid fb marketplace, too many scammers

- [25 May 2021 1:02pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1397176143820722180/): This kind of &ldquo;data massaging&rdquo; (ranking not normalized by pop) has harmful effects beyond simply propaganda. What if those DDS who see this become complacent because they think we have vaccinated more than even Singapore?
Quoted pnagovph&#39;s tweet:   LOOK: The Philippines ranked second among the countries in Southeast Asia in terms of total doses of #Covid19 vaccines administered.
