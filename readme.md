Was I supposed to do this while the laptop was off? because of course it started turning on in the middle of the first 10 seconds.
I also tried it while the laptop was on, in which case it shutdown during the first 10 seconds.
- [2 May 2021 11:54am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/gwngjmo/): I think I&rsquo;ve tried this before; unsure as I&rsquo;ve had this problem for a while and have been looking around for solutions for a while. Regardless, I tried it again today a couple of times, it hasn&rsquo;t changed anything.

I have a 2017 Macbook Air. This one still has the Magsafe charger. My problem with it is that connecting the charger to the device via the Magsafe port is super finicky, most of the time if I just plug it in straight, the device won&rsquo;t charge (the battery status indicator will have the lightning bolt symbol, but if you click on it, the dropdown will say &ldquo;not charging&rdquo;) and the magsafe connector won&rsquo;t light up (if it&rsquo;s charging it will light up either red or green).
- [2 May 2021 6:49am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1388747508688424960/): I‚Äôm at 2. Feels like this number would be significantly lowere here in the PH
Quoted PamelaApostolo1&#39;s tweet:   üè† They say an average person lives in 11 homes in their lifetime.
What‚Äôs your number? (I‚Äôm currently at 8ü§™)

This season felt tighter than the first in terms of pacing and such.But I&rsquo;m not happy with the way it promotes American interventionism and their easy willingness to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign nation (however justified it may be)
