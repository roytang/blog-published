- [23 Feb 2021 10:00pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/lquag0/): Posted on r/StreetFighter: SF5 - is it expected to be so hard to find a match? Filthy casual here. I haven&rsquo;t booted up the game in a while, I play on Steam (though I also have the PS4 copy&hellip; somewhere). Tried to find a match (ranked) last night, around 10pm. My settings are connection 4-5, platform any. Waited for 10 mins, couldn&rsquo;t find a match. Not sure if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m low ranked (ultra bronze i think) while everyone&rsquo;s already silver and up or something?

You queue up, you get paired, it chooses one of the decks in your collection at random (any format), you don&rsquo;t know which until your mulligan decision. (People with &lt; 10 decks get starter decks added to their pool)
