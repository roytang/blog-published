- [16 May 2021 5:33pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/c72ceb2e3748ccd8611baab1cbfdfe74/): I finished reading What Matters Now by Seth Godin, a book that is basically a collection of short blog posts by &ldquo;big thinkers&rdquo;, released for free back in 2009. Interestingly, a lot of the ideas presented in the book still feel relevant today. I didn&rsquo;t think it needed a full review post.
The funniest part for me is that one of the entries is by Jason Fried about how to apologize, advice he certainly could have used during the recent Bandcamp brouhaha
- [16 May 2021 12:28pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1393906113825837058/): @SeresaTagAraw Don&rsquo;t call before 9AM or after 9AM lol
- [15 May 2021 2:47am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1393397698439520259/): @Woerlan aren&rsquo;t you mostly a commander player now anyway? Were you still following the pro scene? (I know I wasn&rsquo;t)
Still hoping GPs come back in one form or another though, those were fun
- [11 May 2021 1:40pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/gxq7jq3/): Oh this happened to me also earlier! I was wondering if there was some onboard effect that I missed that killed me lol
