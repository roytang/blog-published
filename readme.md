- [9 Dec 2020 6:42pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1336743110601162752/): @Westraid Why do you want to work holidays?
- [9 Dec 2020 8:04am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1336703174711803906/): The internet needs to stop telling me things about Tom Holland&rsquo;s 3rd spider-man movie :/
Also, the last time a live action Spider-Man movie tried to tell us there was a multiverse&hellip; well you know what happened there
- [9 Dec 2020 8:10am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1336584083476946944/): I made the most of 2020 by learning Spanish on Duolingo. Check out my progress! #Duolingo365 https://2020.duolingo.com/share.html?rid=BDHTZTB5CWWKTAN665AG5I7KBY
- [5 Dec 2020 10:33am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1335170496153841664/): @visakanv It kind of bothers me that the first tweet in that thread says “2019 tweets”. I know that refers to the quoted 2019 thread, but you otherwise typically start your threads with context for the rest of the thread
- [2 Dec 2020 3:23am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1334095939020046336/): This is how my year sounded on @Spotify. Get your 2020 Wrapped now #2020Wrapped https://open.spotify.com/wrapped/share-fdd70c18adb14e70a29521ce4fc85e96-1080x1920?lang=en&amp;si=Wrpf3LjSQl2kQ6vLM3Olpw
@Spotify basically exactly the same as last year&rsquo;s lol
Quoted roytang&#39;s tweet:   This is how my year sounded on Spotify. Get your 2019 Wrapped #spotifywrapped https://open.spotify.com/wrapped/ddf3e4a1ee43a067d9e011917a96978cb404b9e4
