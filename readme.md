- [10 Jan 2021 11:09am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1348225436602437636/): Over 40. I think yes, even in the 90s. I do remember hearing about things like Saddam invading Kuwait, fall of the Soviet Union, Desert Storm, etc. The main difference for me today is that we get a lot more &ldquo;internal to the US&rdquo; news, or maybe that&rsquo;s just the sources I follow.
Quoted itxaropena&#39;s tweet:   Over 30s of Twitter,
Was your teenage life surrounded with many world events?
- [8 Jan 2021 7:47pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347631047215702016/): I have yet to see any Valki Vartokamus jokes and I am disappointed in all of you #mtg #MTGKaldheim
Quoted SaffronOlive&#39;s tweet:   Geez, god/planeswalker MDFC. At first glance it seems really solid. Valki is good early, Tibalt gives you late game utility.  
- [8 Jan 2021 7:37pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347628452577304576/): If this isn&rsquo;t some allegory for what we face as a country, IDK what is
Quoted PhilippineStar&#39;s tweet:   The Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) on Friday announced the passing of Philippine Eagle Pag-asa, the icon of conservation efforts in the country.  
- [8 Jan 2021 7:31pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347626957047877632/): I wonder if the US cop procedurals (NCIS, etc) have started putting white supremacists/altright nazis/homegrown terrorists into their regular rotation of villains
- [8 Jan 2021 10:23am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347488989385613312/): So far the only thing we can be sure about in the Dacera case is how incompetent our cops are. So, nothing new.
