- [22 Feb 2021 8:19am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1363765401742569474/): Time to (re)mix it up! This pixel perfect adventure is one you don’t want to miss.

- [22 Feb 2021 7:09am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1363747640391860225/): For some reason, I watched Space Sweepers, a Korean sci-fi movie on Netflix. Fun ride, fairly entertaining, pretty good setpieces and special effects. (They are so far ahead of the local film industry.) Plot a bit predictable. Villain made no sense.
- [20 Feb 2021 1:21am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1362935326239465472/): @art_abon the only surviving humans are the descendants of the first Mars colonists. Their only government: The SpaceX board of directors
- [19 Feb 2021 3:18pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1362783672357724161/): The year is 2398. Earth is no longer habitable, the surviving humans have migrated to space colonies. The entire Earth has been converted into a supercluster of quantum computers with one purpose: to mine bitcoin
