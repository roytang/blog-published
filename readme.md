If you&rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &ldquo;all cops are bastards&rdquo;)
In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.

Also me: Need to lookup how to use the filter function every time
(Note for future me: list = filter(func, list)

Had a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!

The quintessential sports film, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.
