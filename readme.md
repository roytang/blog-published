- [27 Oct 2020 12:00am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/current-status/): Summary:  Like every other sensible person in the pandemic, I am staying hunkered down at home all of the time. Really only going out to get groceries and meds. Work/employment is not a priority.  Current Location:  still living in Quezon City, Philippines.  Work  I still work part-time as a software developer/technical lead/system architect consultant, with the emphasis on part-time. No specific clients I care to mention, though it&rsquo;s easy to find out if you dig around a bit.
