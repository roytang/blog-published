- [19 Feb 2021 3:18pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1362783672357724161/): The year is 2398. Earth is no longer habitable, the surviving humans have migrated to space colonies. The entire Earth has been converted into a supercluster of quantum computers with one purpose: to mine bitcoin

Looks like my internet isn&rsquo;t very good for streaming tonight though =/
