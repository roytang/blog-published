Sadly, internet wasn&rsquo;t too good so I just cut the stream short. Too bad, so sad
Draft didn&rsquo;t feel super good, but I managed to break even in the games. No video because no stream. (In hindsight I could have just recorded locally!) Maybe I&rsquo;ll try streaming a draft again early next week.
