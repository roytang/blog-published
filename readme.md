It&rsquo;s been a while since I read the books so I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it&rsquo;s fine.The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!

Quoted reportrdotworld&#39;s tweet:   The DOH and FDA reminded the public that they do not recommend the use of Ivermectin to treat #COVID19 due to insufficient scientific evidence.

 The drug actively harming people would be more effective but the disadvantage of relying on science is that we can&rsquo;t just make claims like that without evidence.

I thought I drafted a couple of decent yet average decks, but didn&rsquo;t perform too well, had a couple of bad draws. A poor end to my Strixhaven premiere draft run
