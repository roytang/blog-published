- [27 Oct 2020 12:00am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/current-status/): Summary:  Like every other sensible person in the pandemic, I am staying hunkered down at home all of the time. Really only going out to get groceries and meds. Work/employment is not a priority.  Current Location:  still living in Quezon City, Philippines.  Work  I still work part-time as a software developer/technical lead/system architect consultant, with the emphasis on part-time. No specific clients I care to mention, though it&rsquo;s easy to find out if you dig around a bit.
- [26 Oct 2020 3:05am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1320562175245598721/): Local banks need to be making sure their websites work with Firefox. Not everyone uses Chrome!
- [24 Oct 2020 12:15am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/): Despite not having played Eternal since before the pandemic, after reading this tweet from LSV, I signed up for the event he described and got the 7 wins and qualified for the LCQ in the first try. I used Skelle&rsquo;s decklist from here: https://direwolfdigital.com/news/throne-summer-championship-decklists/
I&rsquo;m having fun!
Quoted lsv&#39;s tweet:   This is the perfect time to get into Eternal - you can try any deck you want, you&rsquo;ve got a high-stakes tournament to play in, and there are lots of resources in the article for decklists, strategy guides, and more.
- [23 Oct 2020 1:57pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/a38e76d18c18ef7048cd755f7374f753/): In a pandemic, we wear masks to protect others.
On the internet, we should avoid Facebook to protect others.
- [23 Oct 2020 1:14pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319628147726270467/): Unlikely, as long as their fanbase remains rabid. Here in the Philippines, Marcos&rsquo; children have risen the ranks in local politics unrepentant of and despite their father&rsquo;s infamy, on the back of patronage and propaganda
Quoted JessicaValenti&#39;s tweet:   One day Ivanka will try to separate herself from her father in an attempt to reenter polite society. There will be a tearful confession, a book deal, or a glossy PR campaign.
