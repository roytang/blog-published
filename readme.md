- [4 Jun 2021 2:04am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400634591166156805/): Binged thru S5 of Kim&rsquo;s Convenience yesterday. Still so easy to background-watch. Too bad it&rsquo;s the final season, they still had a few open threads to resolve.
https://www.avclub.com/simu-liu-opens-up-about-his-anger-and-unhappiness-over-1847022561 Apparently there&rsquo;s a planned spinoff starring Shannon, who&rsquo;s the second-worst character on the show! WTH. (Worst character is Janet lol)
- [2 Jun 2021 5:11pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400137937212248065/): If you are old enough, remember when the internet was shiny and new and we all thought it would be the cure for stupidity because everyone would have access to the world’s information at the click of a mouse?
How wrong we were.
- [2 Jun 2021 1:35pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400083631519850498/): Would love to be proven wrong, but I dont think they would withdraw the face shield mandate because that would involve admitting to a mistake.
Quoted gideonlasco&#39;s tweet:   It will take around 500 years for face shields to decompose, but it will only take 5 seconds for IATF to admit that they made a mistake in requiring it in all settings.  
- [2 Jun 2021 8:44am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce/): Watched Moonraker (1979). Spectacular opening sequence. Villain reminds me of Tyrion Lannister. California -&gt; Venice -&gt; Rio de Janeiro. Mandatory canal chase while in Venice, obviously. Lots of of product placement. A bad guy tried to ambush 007 with a KENDO STICK. Have they heard of guns? Comically indestructible assassin Jaws appears again, and actually has a character arc this time. First half of the movie was kind of meh, but the last third of the film with the space station and the laser battles and the ridiculous villain plan kind of won me over with how campy it all was.
