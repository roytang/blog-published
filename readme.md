We deserve a world where nobody has to hustle.

Today was another double draft day. One of these was the worst Kaldheim run so far, the other was a bit better. Guess which is which!

Managed to do two drafts this time. One of them was a monowhite deck, while the other was a 3 color pile. Easy to predict which one did better.
