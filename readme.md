- [26 May 2021 3:00pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1397568294383611906/): I should look for a map which highlights Taiwan and make a similar entry (as below) to the bot. #TaiwanIsACountry
Quoted triviastorm&#39;s tweet:   #31163 Name the country in Europe: #trivia  
- [25 May 2021 1:02pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1397176143820722180/): This kind of &ldquo;data massaging&rdquo; (ranking not normalized by pop) has harmful effects beyond simply propaganda. What if those DDS who see this become complacent because they think we have vaccinated more than even Singapore?
Quoted pnagovph&#39;s tweet:   LOOK: The Philippines ranked second among the countries in Southeast Asia in terms of total doses of #Covid19 vaccines administered.

Quoted johnayliff&#39;s tweet:   I don&rsquo;t have time to learn how to make mods for Stellaris, but if I did&hellip; Galactovision Song Contest  
- [23 May 2021 5:27am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1396336876928126980/): the first thing our new hire did was fix a bug that&rsquo;s been bugging him forever as a user prior to joining.
he then breathed a sigh of relief and submitted his two weeks&rsquo; notice. wtf??

I actually started checking this because this reddit thread claimed that if your win% is at least 56% then the upcoming draft challenge should be profitable, so I just miss that threshold lol. Area for improvement!
