Only one draft this session, but I had a lot of fun! Mostly because it was my first 7-win of the season, but also because I drafted an insane quandrix deck with the other 3 colors splashed, and won 3 games off Approach of the Second Sun. I never got to activate codie though!

Managed to do 2 drafts today. First one with Witherbloom only went 3 wins, but I managed 4 wins with the second one using Quandrix before a matchmaking bug ended my draft prematurely (hopefully we get reimbursed!)
