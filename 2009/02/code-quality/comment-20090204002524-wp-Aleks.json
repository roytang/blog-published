  "text": "Refactoring is an investment. You should be able to justify the effort to refactor the code on its long-term benefits. \n \nAs for code reviews, I now think that its effectivity is largely dependent on when it&#39;s conducted. It&#39;s less effective when the developer is already done with the whole module/functionality and the QA team is about to do their thing. I think it&#39;s better to conduct the reviews when the developer has done a little coding and his design has been laid out.",
