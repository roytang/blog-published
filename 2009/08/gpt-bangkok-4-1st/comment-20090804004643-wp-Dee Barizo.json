  "text": "Congrats on the win :)\n \nI thought about how I would build your sealed deck before I looked at your actual build.  My build was very close to yours - just off by two cards.  I would&#39;ve gone -1 Assassinate, -1 Runeclaw Bear, +1 Rampant Growth, and +1 Divine Verdict.  I like going with consistency over power especially if my deck is already pretty good.\n \nAlso, in your draft, I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t play Armorer Ascension, Gorgon Flail, and Magebane Armor.  Those three cards seem better that Cancel, Negate, and Whispersilk Cloak.\n \nAnyways, good luck at the Grand Prix!",
