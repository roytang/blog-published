  "text": "He rules that I&#39;m correct that I&#39;m getting &lt;b&gt;2 extra combat steps&lt;/b&gt;, and my opponent scoops. I later found out that while the ruling was correct, there was some missing information. Reading the card carefully, you&#39;d see that while I would get 2 additional combat steps, I would only get to untap the Rhox War Monk during the first combat step!\n \n---- I play Finest Hour too. However, I&#39;m unsure about the judge&#39;s ruling about this. The same situation happened to me last Friday. However, the judge ruled that we only get 1 extra combat step considering that &quot;it&#39;s the first combat phase of the turn&quot; as stated on the card. Oh well, off to the forums and FAQ&#39;s for me...",
