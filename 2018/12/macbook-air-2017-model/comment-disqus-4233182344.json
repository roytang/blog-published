Only the 2016 models have actual defective (easier to break) keys. It's really more about personal preference at this point. I love the new keyboard switches they have on the mac, and now the 2015 and below models feel mushy in comparison. But before I decided to buy I went to the store to try out the keyboard myself for a few times if I liked it or not.</p>", "date": "2018-12-10 05:10:13", "photo": ""}
