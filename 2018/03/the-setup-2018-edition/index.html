<p>While browsing through my old blog posts, I found one about <a href="https://roytang.net/2010/06/the-setup/">my setup from 2010</a>. I figured it was a good time to do an update. I like doing posts like these because it provides an easy reference for me to look back and see what I was working with at a certain point in time.</p>
<h3 id="what-hardware-do-i-use">What Hardware Do I Use?</h3>
<p><strong>Desktop.</strong> I bought a new desktop rig back in late 2015, here are the specs:</p>
<p>Case: Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B</p>
<p>Fan: 120mm internal aux fan</p>
<p>PSU: Cooler Master B600 V2 600W</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i5-4460</p>
<p>MB: ASUS H97ME</p>
<p>RAM: 2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600</p>
<p>Graphics: Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb</p>
<p>SSD: Samsung 850Evo 250gb</p>
<p>HDD: Seagate 2tb</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 OEM which I immediately upgraded to Windows 10 (upgrade was free at that time)</p>
<p>This cost significantly more than any desktop I had assembled before, but it&rsquo;s worth it. Still going strong up to now. Can easily handle most programming tasks I throw at it, including the notoriously resource-hungry Android development process and of course Google Chrome. Pretty good for gaming as well, although I&rsquo;m not really the &ldquo;4k 120fps&rdquo; kind of gamer.</p>
<p>I have two old monitors (a 19″ and a 21″) hooked up to this desktop (haven&rsquo;t bothered buying a new monitor&hellip;  it&rsquo;s on my list).</p>
<p>Late last year I also impulse-bought a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2016, I&rsquo;m mostly happy with it (it&rsquo;s my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; mechanical keyboard&rdquo;) Recently one of the keys has been acting up, being a bit unresponsive but it got better after I removed the keycaps and cleaned up a bit under there.</p>

<p>As you can see above, I also have a much wider desk now than the dinky old computer table in the old post.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop.</strong> My only laptop currently is a work-issued Acer Aspire ES1-433-38DR. It&rsquo;s nice and handy and workable, but it&rsquo;s not even a year old and I&rsquo;ve already had some issues with the laptop suddenly dying when it&rsquo;s not plugged in. For this reason (and a few other reasons like being able to publish iOS apps), I&rsquo;ve been considering getting a Macbook Pro. (The only thing holding me back is the ridiculous price!)</p>

<p><strong>Gaming consoles.</strong> Gaming is one of my indulgences, so there&rsquo;s a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>I still have a PS3, but it&rsquo;s no longer the original model from the old post. We had to buy a new one after some time because the original conked out. The PS3 is rarely used nowadays however. I still keep it around because I actually still have some backlog that I like to fantasize about finishing one day. *Shakes fist at Ni No Kuni*</li>
<li>I also have a WiiU that I purchased around 2012 or 2013 I think. My WiiU library isn&rsquo;t huge, but it let me play 3 different Zelda games! I often think about getting a Switch, but I want to finish what remains of my WiiU library first. (Only Twilight Princess and Earthbound remain AFAIK)</li>
<li>I have a PS4, purchased in October 2014. My PS4 library is larger than my WiiU one, but these days I typically only play one game on either console at a time.</li>
<li>I also bought a <a href="https://roytang.net/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/">Steam Link</a> to stream gaming from my desktop. I use my Logitech F710 wireless controller with it. It&rsquo;s great when I have platformers on Steam that I want to play.</li>
<li>Handhelds: I have both a <a href="https://roytang.net/2013/06/handheld-gaming-2013-playstation-vita-vs-nintendo-3ds/">PS Vita and a 3DS</a>. Okay, actually I have two 3DSes, the other one is a 3DSXL. I rarely do handheld gaming anymore though, unless there&rsquo;s a long ride or something. I do still tend to carry one of these whenever I go out with a bag. Just in case.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TV.</strong> Mid 2017 one of our 32-inch Samsung TVs in the house conked out with a bad display so we decided to buy a new one. We decided on a <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-43UH6500-4k-uhd-tv">43″ LG Smart TV</a>. Super happy with this, the display is much better than the previous TV. IDK how it works, I think they have some sort of software optimization that makes things look better. It&rsquo;s great for Netflix, Youtube, Gaming, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Tablet.</strong> I have an 9.7″ iPad Pro that I bought late 2016. I also bought an Apple Pencil for it, my main intention was to have a tool for sketching. Pretty happy with it, even though it looks pretty battle-scarred by now as I&rsquo;m not the most careful user.</p>
<p><strong>Cellphone.</strong> Wow, I was still using the Nokia 5800 in that last post. I&rsquo;ve gone through quite a few Android smartphones since then, mostly Samsung Galaxy models, with the most recent one being a secondhand S5. I always have problems with battery life (probably due to being on data all the time) so last December I decided to buy myself an ASUS Zenfone Max 4. It&rsquo;s not as high-spec as the Samsung Galaxy line, but this has 10000mAH battery which means I can go all day without having to scrounge around for a charger. I haven&rsquo;t used my Powerbank in a while!</p>
<p><strong>Others.</strong> I have a 10,0050mAH Asus Zenpower powerbank that was way more useful before I got the Zenfone. (I just now realized they&rsquo;re related brands). I also have a Fitbit Charge 2 for some reason. I find it more useful for tracking my walking than the mobile apps I used to use.</p>

<p><strong>OS.</strong> Windows 10 is mostly serviceable. I&rsquo;d love to have a Linux setup as well, but it&rsquo;s difficult to justify that as a primary OS when Windows has games! Instead I have a Linux Mint VM that I run on my desktop when I need to do Linux-y stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Text Editor.</strong> These days any programming I do usually involves some combination of Python, JavaScript/Node or PHP, so the text editor is my weapon of choice. I tried <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> for a while, but it was a tad too slow for my tastes. I also tried <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, which is great and has everything I need but for some reason keeps nagging me to pay for it. Recently I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, which has been pretty good so far so for now it&rsquo;s my main editor.</p>
<p><strong>Other Programming Stuff.</strong> For times that I need to dig into any Java stuff, I also still have an installation of <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/mars/">Eclipse Mars</a> on my machine. (I don&rsquo;t miss Eclipse). I also have Unity3d installed on my desktop, as I still like to pretend I have time to work on one of my gamedev projects. For SSH, I used to use Putty, but lately I discovered the great <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/">&ldquo;Bash on Ubuntu on Windows&rdquo;</a>. The name is a handful, but it makes doing Linux shell stuff like SSH and curl and whatever a lot easier.</p>
<p><strong>Web Browser.</strong> Most of my work is web-related and I often use cloud resources, so the web browser is important. I recently switched from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox as my main browser, since the latest Firefox promised a bunch of speed improvements. TBH, I can&rsquo;t quite tell the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Office Suite.</strong> As mentioned above, I often use cloud resources, so it&rsquo;s mostly GMail, Google Calendar, Google Drive and Google Docs/Sheets for my needs. I also have a local installation of <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> because sometimes I have to open Excel files that are hundreds of megabytes large and Google Sheets refuses to import it. For cloud storage, my preference is Dropbox.</p>
<p><strong>Note-taking.</strong> I&rsquo;ve grown fond of <a href="http://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a>. It&rsquo;s lightweight and handy enough for my usage, and the Android widget means I can use it to capture random thoughts and ideas throughout the day. On the iPad I also use NotesPlus if I happend to be in a meeting where I feel like writing notes down with the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p><strong>Communications.</strong> Usually some combination of Slack + Skype for work-related stuff, although some clients prefer WeChat or WhatsApp so I have those too. For personal comms, it&rsquo;s mostly Viber and FB Messenger and sometimes Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Sketching.</strong> On my iPad I use and am a big fan of the Procreate app for digital sketches, which I think I even paid for a while back.</p>
<p><strong>Odds and Ends</strong>. I have a bunch of other software utilities I often recommend. I use <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC Media Player</a> for watching stuff on my desktop (doesn&rsquo;t everybody?). I use <a href="http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/">Space Sniffer</a> to check disk usage. <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> for the rare instance that I have to do some kind of audio editing.</p>

        IDK actually. It&rsquo;s supposedly part of the Linux Subsystem for Windows so I guess it comes with some other stuff, but I really only use the shell and any relevant command line utils and I don&rsquo;t notice any bloat.
