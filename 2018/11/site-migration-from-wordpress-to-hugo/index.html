<h3 id="leaving-wordpress">Leaving Wordpress</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Wordpress for this blog since circa 2006 I believe, but as I mentioned in an <a href="https://roytang.net/2018/10/django-blog-application/">earlier blog post</a> that I was not 100% happy with using Wordpress for this blog. I have a few issues with Wordpress, none of them a major dealbreaker, but collectively enough to make me consider something else:</p>
<ul>
<li>the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg editor</a> set to become standard in 5.0 was in my experience, very clunky and kinda annoying</li>
<li>the code structure of Wordpress is very deep and complex, sometimes making it difficult for me to make changes I want. I can usually figure it out, but it feels like things are unnecessarily more complicated than they need to be</li>
<li>Wordpress&rsquo;s rich plugin library is a plus, but it also means having to figure out how to have multiple plugins interoperate with each other. An easy example is that I was using a queueing plugin that didn&rsquo;t work great with the Gutenberg editor</li>
<li>Wordpress requires a lot of maintenance, including needing to regularly update plugins for security purposes, and comment moderation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="static-site-generators">Static Site Generators</h3>
<p>At the same time, while reading across some blogs over the past few months, I had ran into the idea of static site generators, which intrigued me as a Wordpress alternative. SSGs offered several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could compose my posts offline and using any <a href="https://roytang.net/2018/11/my-history-in-text-editors/">text editor</a> I wanted, using a simple format like Markdown</li>
<li>Page load performance is better since Apache will simply serve up the static files, no processing or database hits of any kind</li>
<li>Static sites don&rsquo;t require security updates of any sort - there&rsquo;s no database or admin backend to be hacked</li>
<li>Easy backups. In WP I was using a custom plugin for backups. With an SSG, I can simply have the raw content stored in Github, then the static content &ldquo;built&rdquo; from there. The content always exists in at least three places - the actual site, Github, and my local computer I use for posting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-hugo">Why Hugo</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a lot of static site generators available right now actually. The most popular one seems to be <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which is ruby-based. I first decided to try <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> because I preferred Python over Ruby. However, it turned out problematic on my Windows machine, I encountered some interoperability problems with pandoc for the WP migration. I didn&rsquo;t want to have too many dependencies and issues with dependencies because I would later want to deploy the generator itself to my hosting on Webfaction for automated deployments, so I wanted the setup to be as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which offered two main advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>the MSP was performance. I wanted to migrate over the entire history of the blog, which was almost 900 posts at this point.</li>
<li>no external dependencies - all I needed was to download the hugo executable</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading up and testing a bit of Hugo, I had a fit of &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, I&rsquo;ll just go ahead and do the site migration now&rdquo; that I would later regret since it completely screwed up my sleep schedule.</p>
<h3 id="wordpress-export">Wordpress Export</h3>
<p>I used the <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">Wordpress to Hugo plugin</a> to convert my Wordpress content for Hugo. Many posts had reported problems with this plugin, but I didn&rsquo;t have any issues with its basic operation. I had a two problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>when exporting existing Wordpress comments, it didn&rsquo;t include the commenter&rsquo;s URL, which I felt I should include</li>
<li>all the posts were exported into a single <code>posts</code> folder. While this didn&rsquo;t create any permalinks issues due to each post having the <code>url</code> attribute in the frontmatter, it made the entire folder look very unorganized since I had almost 900+ posts. I preferred that the posts be grouped by year and month, matching the <code>/yyyy/mm/slug/</code> format of the permalink</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I had the source for the plugin, it was straightforward to fix both issues myself.</p>
<p>After getting the export from the plugin, I still had a bit of post-processing and cleaning up of the posts to do.</p>
<p>For one thing, all the single-quotes in the exported posts seem to have been converted to HTML entities for that smart quote thing, so I had to reverse that. Luckily, it was a simple find and replace across text files. The format for embedding posts such as Twitter, Youtube, etc was different as well, I had to correct those files one by one.</p>
<h3 id="cleaning-up-the-taxonomies">Cleaning up the taxonomies</h3>
<p>I had always wanted to clean up the categories in the blog, but I never got around to it with Wordpress because I didn&rsquo;t feel like figuring out the SQL I would have needed to do it. (I&rsquo;ve never liked Wordpress&rsquo;s table structure.). With Hugo, all I had to do was update a bunch of text files, which I was much more comfortable with. This involved simply importing a Python library to <a href="https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/how-to-parse-frontmatter-with-python/">parse frontmatter</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/roytang/blog/blob/master/utils/clean_categories.py">script</a> to do the conversion.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-archive-pages">Generating the archive pages</h3>
<p>Hugo doesn&rsquo;t have built-in support for archive pages, so I had to create them myself. I followed the setup described in <a href="https://blog.atj.me/2017/10/generate-yearly-and-monthly-archive-pages-with-hugo-sections/">this blog post</a> and wrote a python <a href="https://github.com/roytang/blog/blob/master/utils/create-archives.py">script</a> to generate the individual year/month archive pages.</p>
<p>A bigger problem was the archive listing (the page that would link to the individual archive pages). Because the blog has been running for 15 years, there&rsquo;s a whole lot, so I preferred to organize them in a table like this:</p>

</div>

<p>I actually couldn&rsquo;t find a decent Wordpress plugin that did this for me exactly, so I wrote my <a href="https://github.com/roytang/wp_grid_archive/">own plugin</a> for this.</p>
<p>For Hugo, I struggled with this a while and was close to figure out when I finally got the approach right. CHeck <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/archives">my archives page</a> for how it turned out. The upside is I got to become a bit familiar with <a href="https://golang.org/,">https://golang.org/,</a> particularly the way content is parsed and processed in Hugo templates.</p>
<h3 id="custom-shortcodes">Custom shortcodes</h3>
<p>I had some custom-formatted code in Wordpress that wasn&rsquo;t exported properly by the plugin. This required I create some new shortcodes for Hugo and replace the corresponding calls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spoilers. I had only recently added this WP plugin, and only one post was using it so this was straightforward. I created the spoiler shortcode and added some simple jQuery-backed code to toggle the spoiler content. I would have preferred doing this with vanilla JS so as to avoid the jQuery dependency, but I decided to put off learning how to do that for another day.</li>
<li><a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/categories/magic-the-gathering">MTG</a> Decklists and card links. Individual card links wasn&rsquo;t an issue - I just generated an anchor as needed, and had to clean up some of the pages that used it. The decklist part was more challenging, as it involved a lot of text parsing. I managed to get it working to a point where the decklists were formatted correctly, but individual cards weren&rsquo;t linked, before deciding to give up. The main issue is I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to parse each line to split the card count and the card name, if the card count exists, i.e. &ldquo;3 Lightning Bolt&rdquo;. I considered just adding JavaScript to format the contents post-load, but the current behavior will do for now. Maybe I&rsquo;ll even revisit the Hugo parsing issue later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="redirects">Redirects</h3>
<p>I wanted to minimize changes in the URLs of older content, so the permalinks for the old posts were kept in place. Another issue was the RSS feed, generated at <code>/index.xml</code> by Hugo, which I wanted at <code>/feed/</code> so that feed readers don&rsquo;t need to be updated. A simple redirect in .htaccess was enough to get this done. I&rsquo;m not much good at regexes, so I had to reference another <a href="https://blog.philipphauer.de/moving-wordpress-hugo/">blog post</a> for this one. The RSS feeds for categories/tags has changed, I think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-deployment">Automatic Deployment</h3>
<p>I referenced another <a href="https://gomakethings.com/automating-the-deployment-of-your-static-site-with-hugo-and-github/">blog post</a> for setting up automatic deployment. The main difference was my host was Webfaction while his was Digital Ocean, which did cause me a bit of trouble when I was trying to set up a Github webhook to automatically deploy on every push. It turns out Webfaction doesn&rsquo;t allow me to set an env variable in .htaccess to be read by the PHP script (as was in the blog post linked above). It took me a while to figure out this was the issue, so I just gave up on the Github webhook for now and just set a cron job to periodically pull and redeploy the site. I needed the cron job anyway, if I wanted to support future publishing and possibly some form of queueing later on.</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Legacy comments from WP are imported directly into the markdown of each page. Future comments are now handled using Disqus. I already had a Disqus account before, I forgot why I stopped using it. That being said, outsourcing the comments makes a lot of sense.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>we lose the site search for now. There are some workarounds, including Google SiteSearch (I believe it has ads) or building a JSON index and searching on the client-side (seems impractical given the number of posts). I believe I&rsquo;m the only one using the site search anyway, I&rsquo;ll revisit this at another time.</li>
<li>the markdown engine allows raw HTML in the content, but if you have any line breaks in between, your structure breaks, so that required some cleanup</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme">Theme</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not much of a CSS/site design guy, I&rsquo;m more a &ldquo;find an existing theme and tweak it to your liking&rdquo; guy, so I browsed Hugo&rsquo;s available themes for a while and settled on <a href="https://github.com/enten/hyde-y">Hyde-Y</a>, which I proceeded to modify a bit, adding a picture to the sidebar and so on. It&rsquo;s simple and clean and straightforward, nothing too fancy. Maybe I&rsquo;ll revisit the theme later.</p>
<p>For posterity&rsquo;s sake, a screenshot of the new layout/theme:</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>At the end of it, it turned out a bit more effort than I expected. I&rsquo;ll probably be cleaning up the exported older posts every so often because I&rsquo;m OC that well. The theming/templating turned out to be a bit more complicated than I expected, but I think it was easier to manage than Wordpress. The last time I tried to use a custom blog engine, I got tired of maintaining and upating it so I switched back to Wordpress, hopefully that doesn&rsquo;t happen here. Not having to maintain a web interface is a pretty good indicator.</p>
<p>Despite the effort, the great thing is that I did learn a few things, so at the minimum it&rsquo;s already a win:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bit of GoLang</li>
<li>how to create Github Webhooks</li>
<li>more .htaccess stuff</li>
<li>usage of pathlib.Path in Python3 (no more os.glob for me!)</li>
</ul>
