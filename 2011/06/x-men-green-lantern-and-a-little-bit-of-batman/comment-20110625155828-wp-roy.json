  "text": "I don't actually mind Magneto in the yellow and blue. I guess in my head he wasn't really that guy yet. I agree that the wisecracking Hal Jordan wasn't particularly keeping true to the character, but at least they kept it to a minimum and most of the jokes are left in Hal's apartment. I agree that Reynolds is a terrible choice though, as it's hard to take him seriously :p",
