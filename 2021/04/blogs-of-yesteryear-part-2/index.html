<div class="e-content">

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/">&ldquo;Blogs of Yesteryear&rdquo;</a>. This is the remainder of my blogroll from 2004/2005. I feel like the second half is less interesting than the first half, but I figured I might as well go through them as well.</p>
<h3 id="geekiness">geekiness</h3>
<p>I think the blogs under this session are about general geeky topics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absurd Genius</strong> - looks this was a tech and gaming-focused blog that featured a web portal for the PSP browser. But I couldn&rsquo;t find anymore information about the author. It was formerly hosted on base2.org, but that domain doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any content now.</li>
<li><strong>Forever Geek</strong> - this was a blog that covered a lot of geeky topics - tech, anime, gadgets, games, etc. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://forevergeek.com/">still around</a>! I no longer follow them though, mainly because that&rsquo;s not really the sort of site I follow anymore.</li>
<li><strong>kuro5hin</strong> - this was a slashdot-like discussion site that was a bit popular back in the day. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin">Wikipedia</a>, the site was taken down permanently in 2016. Kuro5hin was owned by Rusty Foster, who now writes a newsletter, <a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/">Today in Tabs</a>, one of the <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/newsletters-redux/">newsletters I follow</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gaming">gaming</h3>
<p>I followed a lot of gaming sites back in the day. I no longer follow these, mostly because I&rsquo;m not interested anymore in having 100% gaming feeds in my feedreader.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>game girl advance</strong> - a gaming blog with all women writers. Back then most of the people writing about games were male (I think), so following a site like this one helped diversify your POVs. The site is <a href="https://www.gamegirladvance.com/">still up</a>, but the last update is from 2015.</li>
<li><strong>GameDevBlog</strong> - this is a blog by game developer Jamie Fristrom. I think I followed this site after I read an interesting article he wrote about implementing web-swinging in the 2004 videogame Spider-man 2. His <a href="https://www.gamedevblog.com/">site is still up</a> and updated as recently as last October!</li>
<li><strong>Games from Within</strong> - this was another game developer&rsquo;s blog (in case it isn&rsquo;t obvious, it is/was one of my interests). The <a href="https://gamesfromwithin.com/">site is still up</a>, last post is from 2018. (Annoyingly, it&rsquo;s one of those sites that doesn&rsquo;t show the post date on the listing screens.)</li>
<li><strong>RPGamer</strong> - a gaming site focused on computer/console RPGs. This and <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/">RPGFan</a> were my main source of RPG news back in the day. RPGamer is <a href="https://rpgamer.com/">still up</a> and going strong. (The site even still has the same dragon logo and font!)</li>
<li><strong>These Damned Machines Are Killing Me</strong> - another gaming focused blog, this one was short-lived, looks like it wasn&rsquo;t updated past 2007, after which the site went down. The <a href="http://www.damnedmachines.com/">URL</a> currently redirects to a site called Furious Games, not sure if related.</li>
<li><strong>3rd World Game Designer</strong> - this was a blog by Gabby Dizon, a game designer from the Philippines! (I&rsquo;m always interested in local content). The site is no longer accessible and the domain is parked. I think I found the author on Twitter, but he seems to be a crypto guy now or some such.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comics">comics</h3>
<p>I still read webcomics these days, though not as much, and almost never through a feed reader (most of the time.) Related: <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2006/10/webcomics-i-like-2006-edition/">Webcomics I Like, 2006 Edition</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PvPonline</strong> - this was a webcomic about the employees at a gaming publication, it was quite popular back in the day. The <a href="http://pvponline.com/">site is still up</a> and the author recently rebooted/time-skipped the story. I currently follow <a href="https://twitter.com/pvponline">the author on Twitter</a> and catch up on it whenever I see him update.</li>
<li><strong>Penny Arcade</strong> - one of the longest-running mostly-gaming-focused webcomics (and one of the most well-known). The <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/">site is still going strong</a> after all these years, sporting largely the same color scheme. I get updates because I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/cwgabriel">the artist on Twitter</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Comics: Foxtrot</strong> - one of my favorite slice of life strips, I have a few of the books. It stopped being released as a daily a while back, and the author now only releases a new comic every Sunday, I think. Once again, I am following <a href="https://twitter.com/billamend">the artist on twitter</a>. (Starting to see a pattern here.)</li>
<li><strong>Comics: Sinfest</strong> - it started out as a dark humor strip about this guy Slick who tries to hit on a girl named Monique and just kept expanding and expanding its scope, covering topics such as politics, patriarchy, religion, that kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://sinfest.net/">still running</a> but I mostly lost interest when he tended to do arcs that ran really long. I much preferred his silly, standalone strips like <a href="https://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2004-04-05">this one about Apples and Oranges</a>. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/08/1042004246/">another one that I liked</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Dilbert</strong> - this famous strip is of course still running (currently at <a href="https://dilbert.com/">Dilbert.com</a>), although the author has in recent years come out as Trump supporter with many bad takes. I still read the strip, mostly because it comes with our daily newspaper. (On paper! We still have those!)</li>
<li><strong>Real life comics</strong> - this was a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life comic about a guy named Greg. I had stopped following it for a while because of reasons, but last year I found out that (a) it was still going strong; and (b) the author recently <a href="https://twitter.com/reallifecomics/status/1284587454968651777">came out as as trans</a>. The strip is <a href="https://www.reallifecomics.com/index.php">still running</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Comics: Calvin and Hobbes</strong> - the quintessential comic about a little kid and his tiger. I&rsquo;m not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C&amp;H, so there&rsquo;s no reason to follow it now.</li>
<li><strong>Websnark</strong> - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics. I don&rsquo;t remember following it for too long, probably lost interest at some point. The domain currently has nothing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lifehacks">lifehacks</h3>
<p>These are blogs I followed about self-improvement, productivity, that kind of stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Smart</strong> - looks like this was a blog from a guy who was head of a Christian publishing company. I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don&rsquo;t remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly. The site is no longer accessible and he no longer seems to be blogging.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Pavlina&rsquo;s Blog</strong> - this is a guy who became well-known as a self-help author and motivational speaker. He often wrote about personal development. I&rsquo;m not really into that kind of content anymore so I no longer follow him. He still writes at stevepavlina.com.</li>
<li><strong>43 Folders</strong> - a site about &ldquo;tricks, hacks and other cool stuff&rdquo;, named after the number of manila folders in a tickler file. The site is <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">still around</a>, but the last update is from 2011. I&rsquo;m currently following <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">the author on twitter</a>, he no longer seems to be blogging and is more of a podcaster now.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feed-readers">feed readers</h3>
<p>According to the old site, my feeds back then were powered by an app called Bloglines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines">Wikipedia</a> says Bloglines became unavailable in 2015, but presumably I stopped using it in 2007 when I <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/01/newshutch-feed-aggregator/">switched to a different app called Newshutch</a>. At the time, I was complaining that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a>, released in 2007, was &ldquo;slow as molasses&rdquo;! I eventually did migrate to Google Reader and was a faithful user until <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/06/347364993144074241/">it was killed off in 2013</a>. (In hindsight, this was more recent than I thought it was!)</p>
<h3 id="what-about-now">what about now?</h3>
<p>I follow a mostly different set of blogs now. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/">a blogroll</a>, but it&rsquo;s a touch out of date and could use some updating. Maybe sometime soon. Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader). Feel free to send me blogs or blogrolls you recommend, I will gladly spend an hour or so scrolling through a blogroll and clicking through links and checking out blogs!</p>
