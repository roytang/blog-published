<h2>FooD</h2>
<h3>cheese</h3>
<b><h2>Why is it safe to eat the mold in 
bleu cheese?</h2>
Yoav Perry, Artisan cheesemaker</b>
<p><b>Generally speaking</b>
, the aversion from mold in foods comes 
from the cognition that mold on fresh foods clearly indicates 
that they are no longer fresh. We also assume that food would 
not taste the same because a fermentation has began to take 
place, usually accompanied by change in appearance, texture, 
and aroma of the food in question. Many molds simply taste 
unpleasant, yet are not problematic to our bodies. Dangerous 
molds are those which produce mycotoxins and aflatoxins. 
These toxins may effect our respiratory system and in some 
cases even act as carcinogens. not all molds produce these 
toxins. </p>
<p><b>Penicillium Roqueforti</b>
 and <b>Penicillium Glaucum</b>, which 
are the blue molds used for cheese, cannot produce these 
toxins in cheese. The combination of acidity, salinity, moisture, density, temperature, and oxygen flow creates an environment that is far outside the envelope of toxin production 
range for these molds. In fact, this is true for almost all molds 
in cheese, which is the reason that cheese has been considered 
a safe moldy food to eat over the past 9,000 years. not only is 
it safe, but it can also be healthy (P.Roqueforti and P.Glaucum 
have natural antibacterial properties and ability to over-take 
pathogens. Moreover, our bodies use a variety of wild flora for 
digestion, development and immune systems). </p>
<p>Unfortunately, mass food manufacturers have run relentless campaigns over the previous few generations to cause 
consumers to conclude (beyond their 9,000 years of wisdom) 
that plasticy looking bright-colored food-like substances with 
homogenous texture, in a vacuum-pack and big brand logo 
equal controlled/safe products. Anything moldy, rustic, irregular, inconsistent, or natural equals unsanitary conditions, 
primitive family farming, or uncontrolled production. Today, 
we understand that this is not the case as we go back to traditional and artisan foods . . . and stay away from highly processed industrial food replacements. </p>
<p><b>Blue Molds</b>
 have a particularly unique effect on cheese. 
They accelerate two processes dramatically: <b>Proteolysis</b>
(breakdown of proteins), which causes the cheese to take 
on extra-creamy texture (especially in proximity to the blue 
mold veins), and <b>lipolysis</b> (breakdown of fats), which makes 
up the tangy, spicy, sharp and strong flavor. The creamy texture stand up to the sharp flavor and together they bring upon 
an exciting flavor/texture/aroma profile, which is often further balanced against sweet/nutty milk and lots of salt (blue 
cheeses typically contain twice the salt of other cheeses). This 
combination is so unique; it is unlike any other food!</p>
the process
<p>Before going into the second part of the question (
<i>&ldquo;Can one 
"bleu-ify" other cheeses at home?&rdquo;</i>) let's just understand the 
process in a nutshell:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Blue mold grows only during a specific time frame within 
the aging period. It needs a balanced acidity, so it can't 
grow on the cheese if is too young and still acidic. It also 
relies on nutrients that are still readily available in the 
cheese, so it can't be too late when the cheese is already 
aged.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The mold spores are highly contagious to other cheeses, 
so blue cheeses typically would not share aging space with 
other cheeses during this sensitive period.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The cheese is usually pierced with a thick needle first so 
that oxygen will flow into its crevices and kickstart the 
growth. The cheesemaker would repeat this process every 
seven to fourteen days until sufficient growth of blue has 
taken place.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
At this point, the cheese is wrapped in foil to prevent the 
blue from growing out of control. The cheese is then immediately moved to cooler temperature and aged for the 
remaining period, allowing the processes of proteolysis 
and lipolysis to take place and develop deep and complex 
texture, flavor, and aroma. In some cases, this last stage 
could take up several months past the development and 
stoppage of the blue mold.</p>
Bluing cheese at home
<p>Trying to blue an unsuspecting cheese at home may prove 
difficult. The cheese you purchase is often already aged, ripe, 
and stable. It lacks sufficient nutrients to support the growth 
of new blue mold. Competition from other well-established 
molds and yeasts in the rind may be too much for the blue to 
overcome at such late stage.</p>
<p>Having said that, this is not an impossible experiment. 
one just needs to find a cheese that is very young and has little or no rind. It must be moist enough to support the growth 
of this mold, yet it firm enough to enable the puncture a hole 
through it with a knitting needle. To "blue" it, one would need 
blue mold (can be purchased or scraped off moldy rye bread 
or another blue cheese, or simply pulverize a piece of blue 
cheese in a blender with a little bit of water and a pinch of 
salt). The procedure would be to sanitize a knitting needle 
or metal skewer and dip it in the mold to "contaminate" it 
with blue. Use it to pierce the cheese through from both ends 
to assure ample mold seeding and clear air passages. Set the 
cheese on its side so air can flow through it. It is best to start 
it at about 55&deg;F or 13&deg;C (temperature of a wine cooler) with 
high humidity (90%&ndash;95%). When the growth of blue is sufficient (one to three weeks) wrap with foil and move to the 
fridge for a few more weeks or months. In theory this should 
work but blue cheese are finicky and tricky to get right. Many 
variables may still fail it.</p>

<h3>food industry</h3>
<b><h2>How do supermarkets dispose of 
expired food?</h2>
Brian Lee, Student</b>
<p>During my time working in both management and part-time 
capacities at a large supermarket, I can tell you that the evolution of what happens with food past its sell by date has been 
pretty fascinating. There is a distinction to note that there are 
generally several dates associated with food. There is a sell by 
date, a best by date, and an expiration date. </p>
<p>The short answer to your question is, yes, a lot of food gets 
thrown out. <br/>
The long answer is that most supermarkets do a very 
good job of minimizing this waste. Almost all departments, 
especially ones with perishable items, order to sell out and 
should come very close to running out before their next order arrives. Think about that the next time your supermarket 
is out of fresh wild salmon. Would they really bring in one 
extra twenty pound case just to sell you an eight ounce fillet 
at 8PM the night before fresh fish arrives? Depends on the 
market and how aggressively the store wants to capture sales, 
but mostly, no. <br/>
The blanket rule for food past its expiration date is this: 
if it is unsafe in any way, shape, or form, it gets thrown out. 
They find a way to use almost everything else. </p>
<p><b>Produce</b>
 &ndash; Fruits and vegetables don't come with clear expiration dates. I will tell you that you will probably never see a banana that's turning brown on the racks in the produce department. If some produce isn't sell-able, it usually gets shopped 
around the store. A department that handles any type of prepared foods will use these items to make items for hot bars, 
salad bars, soups, etc. The same goes for meat and seafood 
that is past its sell by date but still within its best by date. </p>
<p>Composting seems like the natural answer for all the other produce that can't be used. This issue has been explored 
and explored at our supermarket, and there are two major 
roadblocks to seeing it in action. </p>
<p><font size="-1">1.</font>
<i>Storage</i> &ndash; Most farms are generally further away from urbanized (or suburbanized) stores. Because produce deteriorates rather quickly farms would have to pick up compostable produce on a daily basis. Storage at the market is 
not an option because a large, rotting pile of fruit would 
attract all sorts of unwanted pests to the store. Daily pickup is difficult, and would the extra monetary and green 
cost of the freight and labor make up for the produce that 
would be picked up? The logistics of the operation are 
more involved than one might initially think. </p>
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
<i>Recalls</i> &ndash; Unfortunately, recalls due to contaminated fruits 
and vegetables do happen. Many of them happen after the 
produce has been in the store for some time. If the store 
composts melons, and those same melons are recalled two 
days later due to a possible salmonella contamination, 
then you have potentially deadly compost making its way 
around your local farms. I am neither an expert in foodborne illness nor composting, so I don't know if there is 
any validity to this concern, but I do know it sounds scary. 
And that's enough to put the issue on the back burner. </p>
<p><b>Bakery</b>
 &ndash; Almost all old baked goods get donated to the local food bank, which disperses it to not for profit agencies in 
the area. every morning, a big shopping cart of old muffins, 
donuts, and bread makes its way to the back dock, and every 
morning at 10AM, a van rolls around and picks it up. </p>
<p><b>Meat and Seafood</b>
 &ndash; Lately, within the past couple of months, 
they've been testing out freezing meats that have just passed 
sell by date and donating these to the local soup kitchens. 
Again, this is still in its infancy, and some issues have arisen 
that have taken the logistics of this back to the drawing board. 
The main issue becomes, and always comes back to, safety. 
Just because a product makes it to its final consumer in a 
frozen state doesn't mean it's 100% safe. What happened to 
the product in the mean time? Traceability is of paramount 
importance until it gets to the store, but the cost involved 
with continuing that traceability until it reaches donations is 
economically unfeasible.</p>
<p><b>Grocery and Dairy &ndash; </b>
Unfortunately, for the same reasons 
Meat and Seafood can't be donated, many refrigerated, expired dairy products don't make the list. The good news is 
that very few items get thrown out. Longer shelf lives, higher 
demand, and tight orders ensure that the only dairy products 
that really get thrown out are the damaged ones that aren't 
safe for consumption anyways. </p>
<p>Grocery items are given to food banks. I'm sure some 
smaller markets donate directly. At our store, everything 
expired is packed and freighted to headquarters, and they 
distribute the goods evenly among the communities that our 
supermarkets are located in. The extra freight may seem 
wasteful, but I am assuming they record their donations for 
tax deduction purposes. </p>
<p>I've had the good fortune to spend some time volunteering at food banks. They have different expiration dates for 
products, which I assume are regulated by some sort of government agency. For example, (I'm just using an arbitrary example, I don't remember the exact dates and figures) canned 
beans may be okay for two years past the date on the can, 
whereas boxed pasta is good for six months past the date on 
the box. The majority of my volunteer time at the food banks 
was spent sorting through the mountains of canned goods 
and checking expiration dates to see what was still deemed 
safe and what wasn't. </p>
So basically, if it's safe, it gets donated. If it's not, it gets 
thrown out. Definitely some food for thought.<br/>

<h3>cooking</h3>
<b><h2>If there were ten commandments 
in cooking what would they be?</h2>
Jonas M Luster, trimethylxanthine addict</b>
<p><font size="-1">1.</font>
 Honor what you use. For every piece of food, every ingredient, every vegetable, slice of meat, herb, or spice, 
someone had to work, an animal had to die, trucks, vans, 
trains, and boats had to move. every celery stalk and every 
pork loin has made a permanent impression on this planet. Honor the men and women who worked for your food, 
the animals who had to die for it, by giving everything the 
best treatment, thinking about how you can make it better, and by not wasting or throwing away food items.</p>
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
Don't lose touch with your food. Tongs and other contraptions only serve to keep you away from it. Losing touch, 
figuratively and literally, yields worse dishes. Touch your 
steaks, your salad, everything. Learn how it feels, smells, 
looks, and tastes.</p>
<p><font size="-1">3.</font>
Try something new every month. Follow foreign cultures 
and preparations. Your life will be richer and your food 
better, even when you're preparing common staples.</p>
<p><font size="-1">4.</font>
 Before you use the tool, learn to do it with your own 
hands. Buying a julienne peeler is nice and can save you 
hours over the course of a lifetime. But only by learning 
how to cut, mash, grind, sear, saute, and whisk with your 
hands will you keep touch with your food and get the best 
results.</p>
<font size="-1">5.</font>
Cook for others. enough said.<br/>
<font size="-1">6.</font> Use fresh where possible, canned where necessary, and 
frozen when desperate.<br/>
<font size="-1">7.</font>
Taste everything. Repeatedly.
<p><font size="-1">8.</font>
 Let your food items come to room temperature before 
throwing them into pans.<br/>
<font size="-1">9.</font>

<h3>wine</h3>
<b><h2>Why do American winemakers 
produce mostly varietals, while 
French winemakers produce 
blends?</h2>
Madeline Puckette, Certified Sommelier at winefolly.com
This is not true. This is a marketing misconception.</b>
<p>There are a lot of well-known blended varietals in France 
such as Cotes du Rhone and Bordeaux wines. However, there 
is also a ton-load of 100% chardonnay, pinot noir, sauvignon 
blanc, and mourvedre that pours out of France as well. </p>
<p><b>In America</b>
, single varietal wines are extremely well marketed, and the drinking public is more familiar with buying 
a wine called "merlot" than buying a wine called "California 
Red Wine," however, red blends are extremely successful in 
the American Market as well. Here's how I suppose this argument: </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
In the American AVA system, a minimum of 75% of that 
single varietal, which allows a huge amount of wiggle 
room to perfect a <i>blend</i>, is named after a varietal. You can 
bet wineries are doing this, especially if it adds dynamic 
flavor (which it usually does, in the case of a pinot noir/
syrah blend) and it's also CHeAPeR. That's why there is 
a huge variable of range between producers.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
In Washington State, winemakers have been championing red blends and rightly so, the blend such as a GSM 
(grenache syrah mourvedre) and a CMS (cab, merlot, 
syrah) have been growing in popularity.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
entry level wines are almost always a blended wine. Visualize these labels "mad housewife" or "apothic red" or 
"house wine," and now you see how common this is. </p>
<p><b>To conclude</b>

<h3>chocolate</h3>
<b><h2>Why are the chocolate chips in 
chocolate chip ice cream generally 
&ldquo;chocolate-flavored chips&rdquo;?</h2>
Andrew Roberts, Food Scientist</b><br/>
Chocolate chips for many frozen applications might be 'chocolate flavored' products. 
<p>The amazing property of cocoa butter, which makes chocolate melt in your mouth (not your ___), is the very steep 
melting profile. Since all fatty foods are made up of a variety 
of fatty acids, they melt over a temperature range, as each 
class of molecules has its own melting point. Think about butter melting on a hot day: there is always a pool of liquid (the 
shortest/most unsaturated fatty acids, with the lowest melting 
points) and some soft, solid butter (the longer ones), holding 
onto its shape. These two phases represent the different melting points of the fatty acids which make up butter.</p>
<p>Cocoa butter behaves differently. Think about the cases 
where chocolate looks solid, but is very soft. In this case, none 
of it has started to drip or pool even though it is dangerously 
close to its melting point. This is a reason real chocolate is so 
great and pleasurable, it all melts at once, intensifying the 
melting experience. </p>
<p>Freezing real chocolate somewhat screws up the melting 
experience. Freezing it in ice cream really screws up this experience. </p>
<p>Frozen chocolate chips will be very cold, and therefore 
take time to heat up and melt in your mouth. They will feel 
chalky at first, but eventually melt if you have a nice warm 
mouth, providing you with that great sensation. When you 
have a mouthful of ice cream, your mouth will not be warm 
enough to melt these chips. They will feel chalky and not melt 
until well after all the ice cream is gone, which most people 
won't wait for. When you bite into them, they will crack and 
taste/feel chalky, brittle, and generally bad. </p>
<p>So, some ingredient company realized there is a market 
for specialty frozen applications chocolate chips. They solved 
this problem by adding some lower melting point fats and oils 
to their product. These might be hydrogenated vegetable oils, 
but now are probably palm oil or fractionated (separated by 
melting point) palm. Lower melting point oils are generally 
healthier, if that is any consolation. What they have achieved 
is a chip that acts somewhat like chocolate when you eat it 
with a relatively cold mouth, full of ice-cream, because it will 
melt at a lower temperature than chocolate. </p>
<p>Luckily, someone is out there protecting us from foodfraud. In many countries, government enforced standards 
exist for foods. These are basically minimum requirements 
that must be met before you can use a name like Chocolate, 
Bacon, Fruit Juice, etc.</p>
<p>These products are likely outside of the Chocolate standard because they are no longer &gt;35% cocoa solids after the 
sugar and added oils. After this, it is just up to the firm making them to choose a non-misleading name for their product. 
Voila, chocolate-flavored chips. This also applies to the liquid 
used for dipped-cones at Dairy Queen and most other frozen 
chocolate you have as part of a commercially produced icecream product. </p>

<h3>medical school</h3>
<b><h2>What is one thing that you regret 
learning in medical school?</h2>
Jae Won Joh, sleepy medical student ^__^</b><br/>
Where  to  begin . . .<br/>
<b>1. How <i>colossally</i> broken the U.S. healthcare system is.</b>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>monumentally</i> undereducated/misguided about 
health/medicine/ethics the people legislating healthcare 
are.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>desperately</i> most physicians avoid thinking about the 
problem; indeed, how many actively contribute to it in order to chase "patient satisfaction," the end-all-be-all these 
days in the highly political hospital world.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i> mercilessly</i> this hurts patients, particularly the underserved.<br/>
<b>2. How <i>uninvested</i> most patients are in their own health.</b>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>lazily</i> most people would rather take a pill to control 
their obesity or cholesterol instead of watching less TV 
and getting up to go do some exercise.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>massively </i>undereducated people are about basic nutrition facts that didn't have to be explained to their ancestors just a few generations ago.</p>
<b>3. How <i>uncertain</i> the practice of "the standard of care" is.</b>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>traditionally</i> defined practices that legitimately may 
negatively affect patient care still survive. "This is how I 
was taught" is something I've heard way too often.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>forcefully</i> evidence-based medicine struggles to make 
the rounds, as many have relatively little experience analyzing a study and how it should or should not affect their 
practice.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i> tremendously</i> difficult it really is to actually prove 
something of clinical value, namely due to the fact that 
ethically, experimentation on humans is seen as horrifyingly unethical . . . but at a certain point, you have to wonder if it's not just as unethical to keep up practices that 
we're not really sure are beneficial to the patient.</p>
<p><b>4. How 
<i>minimally</i> the process of educating a clinician has 
changed to adapt to modern times. Indeed, one wonders if 
we aren't going backwards somewhat.</b></p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>ancient</i> the system is, expecting every medical student to take the same courses/rotations for three years 
and then somehow differentiate themselves into the one 
hundred and forty five different medical specialties. This 
originates from a time when it was legitimately possible 
to know just about everything in the field of medicine with 
enough time/study.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>favoring</i> the system is to subservience, now that we 
have the hierarchy of attending physician, fellow, resident, medical student.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>frightening</i> it is that we emphasize memorizing and 
spewing out answers on tests instead of looking at ways to 
test actual clinical competence.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How <i>poorly</i> the art of the physical exam is taught, in favor 
of far more expensive tests and imaging.
<p>All that said, I still love what I do. There is much I would 
change if I had the power, but simply put, I do not; nor, I suspect, will I ever. So I do what good I can, when I can, where I 
can. We'll see if any of this changes in the years to come.</p>

<h3>choosing colleges</h3>
<b><h2>How does a star engineering high 
school student choose amongst 
MIT, Caltech, Stanford, and 
Harvard?</h2>
Melinda T. Owens, Neuroscience PhD and all-around geek</b>
Ah, this question brings me back to the days I used to be 
smart.
<p>The answer to the question both complicated and, in some 
sense, is very simple. You will be happy with any of these 
schools, because there are amazing people and opportunities 
at all of them. Your happiness and success in life has a lot 
more to do with how you leverage your own abilities and take 
advantage of these opportunities than which school you go to.</p>
<p>That said, there are substantial differences between these 
schools too. First, you should look at how strong each school 
is in your specific areas of interest, both with respect to classes 
and research opportunities. For example, the Harvard math 
department is reputed to be better than the one at Caltech, 
but if you want to design space robots, Caltech has a close 
relationship with JPL. When you do your campus visits (you 
absolutely shouldn't skip those), try to find some senior students in your major and ask if a lot of the class is involved in 
research activities. </p>
<p>Second, figure out how much learning about humanities 
and social science stuff is important to you. You can get a 
much more well-rounded education at Harvard and Stanford 
than at MIT or, especially, Caltech. Also, at the former two 
schools, you will be around more humanities majors and may 
even have to do things like room with them. of course there 
are high-quality humanities classes at even Caltech (I thoroughly enjoyed mine there), but the breadth was limited. </p>
<p>Third, figure out what kind of social scene you like. If you 
identify as a "normal" person, you are going to stand out at 
Caltech (and maybe MIT, although I think that's less of an 
issue there). If you identify as a "nerd," though, you might find 
it harder to find a good social circle at Harvard or Stanford. 
Read the signs posted on the billboards of the campus &mdash; those 
are the activities that students actually like to do.</p>
<p>Fourth, just walk around the campuses of each of these 
schools on your own, and look at the scenery and architecture, and soak in the ambiance. Are there lots of people and 
cars scurrying around? Do the environs affect you emotionally 
(and remember, gray in summer is going to be ten times worse 
in cold and snow)? Is the campus too small or too big? We're 
supposed to be intellectuals and not care about the physical 
environment, but small things like sunshine and flowers can 
make a surprisingly big difference when the going gets tough. </p>
<p>Fifth, read the Quora pages addressing the downsides of 
each school and talk to students who self-identify as being 
unhappy at the schools. That will identify any deal-breakers.</p>
<p>Sixth, check your mail and look at your scholarship offers and financial aid. Caltech, unlike Harvard and I believe 
Stanford and MIT, offers merit-based scholarships. Student 
loan debt may be an abstract thing to you now, but it's a real 
burden if you want to do anything in life that doesn't involve 
making lots of money. </p>
<p>Congratulations on your acceptances (otherwise, stop 
counting chickens before they hatch). When you make a 
choice, embrace it and don't look back.</p>

<h3>higher education</h3>
<b><h2>Are general requirements in college 
a waste of time?</h2>
Joshua Engel, Polymath</b><br/>
Here's the way I think of it: nobody wants to pay you to program a computer. 
<p>Programming, in and of itself, is pointless. It's a bunch of 
bits, a bunch of electrical potentials. nobody cares. <br/>
People want you to program the computer to do stuff. They 
want it to play Angry Birds or show them what their friends 
are doing or help them write a memo. These are things that 
people do, not what computers do. The computer is the tool. 
The human beings are the client. <br/>
The point of the general requirements is to introduce you 
to people: what they think, what they do, what they want. This 
is where you make money. <br/>
Computer people fetishize the programs that they write 
for other computer people, where the computer is the domain 
as well as the tool: the Linux kernel, the Apache server, the 
graphics blitting engines. These are tiny domains, tools for 
other toolmakers. Computer people would rather write code 
that writes code than write code. <br/>
There is, without doubt, a place for the pure research: the 
pure mathematics, the high-energy physics, the computer 
science that's actually computer science rather than a training hub for programmers. These are important domains that 
are removed from applications, though even there, there's a 
case for understanding the eventual context that your work 
will fit into. Your "customers" aren't the papers you write, but 
the people who will read them. Your coworkers will also be 
people, and your social connection to them makes you work 
better, even when what you talk about has nothing to do with 
pharmacokinetics or Galois fields or whatever "pure" field 
you're working in. You have to write proposals, and well-written proposals are going to pay your salary better than poorlywritten ones, no matter solid the technical points. <br/>
But a larger percentage of STeM graduates are going 
to do work for actual people, and you'll do better at it as an 
actual person yourself. The great video games tell stories, and 
you'd better be familiar with some great stories yourself. The 
ergonomics and interfaces of the device you engineer aren't 
going to be glopped on top of your brilliant contraption like 
some kind of awesome sauce. They're built into it from the 
bottom up. <br/>
The humanities are not another collection of facts to 
memorize. They are the introduction, the foundation on 
which your own journey into what it means to be human is 
built. If there's a problem with the humanities requirements, 
it's that you're allowed to get away with a few freshman and 
sophomore level classes under the impression that you've mastered the topics. You wouldn't consider yourself an expert in 
engine design just because you took freshman engineering. <br/>
These classes are supposed to give you the tools to continue the study on your own. If all you do is get through them 
and forget them, then you really have wasted your time. <br/>
If I could wave a magic wand, I'd make every STeM student double-major in some humanities area. That might begin 
to make them qualified to actually do something with their 
STeM knowledge, something that people want. STeM graduates are supposed to be the cream of the crop, and they're 
supposed to find the humanities easy. I'd love to see all of them 
learn music, or history, or Indonesian literature in real depth. 
Who knows what kind of wonderful applications would come 
out of it?</p>

<h3>iraq</h3>
<b><h2>Is Iraq a safer place now compared 
to what it was like during Saddam 
Hussein's regime?</h2>
Wael Al-Sallami, born and raised in Iraq, moved to Texas 
recently.</b>
<p>I'm an Iraqi native. I was born in 1988, just four months 
before the end of the Iraq-Iran war, then survived the IraqKuwait one, and the American attack as a three-year-old. I 
lived through the US-enforced sanctions that did absolutely 
nothing to Saddam, while severely harming the Iraqi people 
in so many ways. I then survived yet another war in 2003 and 
went through the horrific times that took the lives of so many 
good people.</p>
<p>But was it really safer back then? Did the Americans really help Iraqis? Was it worse before 2003?! I think those are 
all misguided questions, and here's why:</p>
<p>Iraq was a really wealthy country back in the 1980s, and 
even though it went through an eight-year long war against 
Iran, its economy wasn't affected that much, and Saddam was 
able to rebuild much of what was destroyed in a matter of 
months. But then Kuwait was lowering oil prices to harm the 
Iraqi economy in a time we needed money most (post-1988) 
and Iraq/Saddam tried to talk them out of it on several occasions, but they didn't back out. So Saddam came up with the 
idea that Kuwait was historically a part of Iraq, and that he 
should claim it back!</p>
<p>While that claim 
<i>is</i> historically true, it wasn't exactly right 
to just go and invade Kuwait and kill a lot of its people! But he 
did it anyways. The result was that the US attacked Iraq, killing many of innocent people in the process. The Iraqi people 
fought back, and the US finally backed out. They later enforced the sanctions that left Iraq cut out from the rest of the 
world and slowly killed the Iraqis!</p>
<p>At the time, my father was a Biology Ph.D student, and 
my mother was a teacher. I had a little sister and an older 
brother. And since my father was teaching in college before 
his Ph.D, the government paid him while he studied. They 
paid him 8000 Dinars/month, the equivalent of $4. My mother's salary was 3000 Dinars, the equivalent of $1.50. A family 
of five people was living off of $5.50/month, and that was the 
case for pretty much all low-level government employees during the 1990s.</p>
<p>It took my father four years to finish his Ph.D in 1998. 
Those four years were by far the worst I've lived, and I've lived 
through some serious shit, trust me. </p>
<p>After 1998, things started to go just a little bit better. 
Saddam was sensing his end, and so he tried to make a few 
improvements in salaries and services. He even tried to introduce a controlled-version of satellite TV as well as wireless 
cellphones. But he didn't have time to finish, because in 2003, 
America struck again. This time with the intention of removing Saddam from power, and yet again, killed thousands of 
innocent people in the process. But there was a particular 
difference this time, the Iraqi people weren't willing to fight 
back. They just sat back while the US Army took over. </p>
<p>And this is why this, and all similar questions, are misguided. Iraq was safer and much wealthier back in the 1980s; 
it was the United States that made it so poor and horrible 
through the 1991 attack and the sanctions. And then, it came 
back in 2003 to <i>save</i> the Iraqi people from what they've done 
themselves after they (the Iraqi people) have grown to hate 
their way of life so much that they were oK with anyone coming in to change it!</p>
<p>And that, my friend, was the most hypocritical move in 
modern history! To add insult to injury, the 2003 war didn't 
change things much. It actually made matters worse! Instead 
of people living really safely but extremely poor, the picture 
flipped, and people became somewhat wealthy, but safety was 
gone with the wind. People had one Saddam to be afraid of, 
now they have hundreds! They used to live safely by keeping 
their mouth shut, now they can't even if they do. Iraqis were 
being killed for having the wrong religion, the wrong place of 
birth, and a lot of the time, the wrong <i>name</i>. 2006 was worse 
than 1991 and 2003 combined. Militias took over, and it was 
chaos.</p>
<p>After 2007, things started to get a little better. Babylon, 
the city I live in, was getting much safer, but Baghdad and 
a few other cities were still dangerous. It took some time for 
them to become relatively safe. But every now and then, we 
still get a few car bombings, suicide bombings, or at least a 
few kidnappings here and there.</p>
<p>My father now makes about $3000/month, my mother 
about a quarter of that, and we live really comfortably financially. But so far, my brother has survived one car bombing, 
and I about <i>four</i>, and that's only because we live in a safe city. 
Chances are I would have already lost a family member if we 
lived in Baghdad. </p>
<p>It might seem that I think the US forces backed down 
in 1991 because the Iraqis fought back. Please note that I'm 
not suggesting that, but rather stating the Iraqis' readiness to 
fight back then in contrast with what happened in 2003. </p>
<p>So, there's your answer. I worked remotely with a startup in nYC, I visited the US for three months in 2010, and 
I've now come back to the US on a scholarship to pursue an 
MSCS at Texas A&amp;M. I have so many good friends here, and 
I know how Americans are sorry and ashamed for what their 
country did to mine. So I personally don't blame the American <i>people</i> for all what I and other Iraqis have been through, 
but facts remain facts, and a lot of Iraqi people really hate the 
Americans for what they did. </p>
<p>I find it sad that no one can see that the American people 
aren't really to blame, or at least find it in themselves to forgive them, because it's always the leadership that does all of 
this, just like our leadership (Saddam) caused the death of so 
many Kuwaitis back in 1991.</p>

<h3>misogyny</h3>
<b><h2>Is Islam misogynistic?</h2>
Anon User</b><br/>
As an Arab American woman raised in a conservative Muslim 
family, I would say that yes, Islam is a misogynistic religion.
<p>The messages about gender that I received from my parents, extended family, family friends, religious teachers, and 
so on ranged from subtle to extreme. I was told, among other 
things, that</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 women can't speak during prayer to correct an Imam 
(men can) because their voices are too "distracting" (This 
is based on the hadith, see http://www.alahazrat.net/islam/the-mode-of-prayer-(salaat)-for-women.php)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 women should lower their eyes in the presence of men 
(http://quran.com/24/30-31, to be fair the stuff about 
lowering one's gaze is also directed towards men, not the 
other stuff though. This surah is significant in that it is often cited as evidence that hijab is a requirement of Islam, 
which is a subject of debate within the religion.)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
women shouldn't wear tampons to preserve their "purity" 
(no quotes from the Qur'an on this as tampons weren't 
around in those days, this is another topic of debate and 
from my understanding, people outside of Islam also debate the issue. So I have only anecdotal comments here 
in that every Muslim woman I've known has been told 
something to this effect, and on a personal level, when 
my mom discovered I was using tampons, she completely 
freaked out, started screaming, and threatened to take me 
to the doctor and have them check to see if my hymen was 
still intact, which seems to be not infrequent behavior &mdash; a 
Muslim friend of mine who was caught skipping class had 
her parents ask the doctor to check her hymen. But again, 
this is anecdotal, and I'm just mentioning this as a qualitative "data point", as it were.)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 passages in the Qur'an that advocate beating disobedient wives (see http://www.bible.ca/islam/islam-wife-beating-koran-4-34.htm, 
https://perfectquran.com/surah/4/
ayah/34, and this paragraph from http://www.sillyallah.
com/2007/11/violent-sexism-and-wife-beating-in.html<i> "In 
fact, the word in the Quran in 4:34 used for "beat" is "idreb." 
It is a conjugate of the word "daraba," which primarily 
means "to beat, strike, to hit" &ndash; Hans Wehr Dictionary of 
Modern Written Arabic, page 538.")</i></p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
polygamy is legal and practiced in many Muslim countries 
and permitted by the Qur'an (see https://perfectquran.
com/surah/4/ayah/3 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Polygamy_in_Islam)</p>
<p>and so on and so forth; honestly it would take me hours (and 
probably lots of therapy) to be able to cogently list all of the 
misogynistic aspects of this religion and the cultures that have 
flourished from it. Maybe some of the aforementioned things 
seem minor, but in my mind they're not negligible, and taken 
together so many things have made me feel like my religion 
hated women. </p>
<p>It's ridiculous to me to hear qualifying statements that Islam is "paternalistic, but not misogynistic." Believe me, as a 
young woman growing up and struggling in Islam, there is 
little to no distinction between the two. </p>
<p>I'm not saying by any means that these characteristics are 
unique to Islam. But the question was not "Is Islam more misogynistic than other religions?" but rather "Is Islam misogynistic?"</p>
<p>Some have mentioned that there is a distinction between 
culture and religion in Muslim countries. I would argue that 
that's not really true, at least not in the way that it is in the 
West. Islam is integrated into Arab cultures in a way that's 
probably unthinkable to many in Western countries. With the 
exception of the occasional very small Christian minority, virtually everyone in Arab countries is Muslim and this basically 
dominates the culture; public newscasters casually attribute 
occurrences to Allah without any controversy, domestic airlines recite surahs from the Qur'an over the intercom during 
flights, and so on.</p>
<p>Muslim countries touted as being more liberal, such as 
Turkey, are such because they are not as strictly and fanatically religious as countries like Saudi Arabia, where the laws 
and regulations are for the most part drawn from edicts in 
the Qur'an and where "religious police" (note that they aren't 
called the cultural police) patrol the streets, harassing women 
for showing their ankles, preventing women from driving, 
enforcing the laws that prevent women from working, or 
traveling without permission from a male guardian, and oh, 
don't forget "beating young girls" to prevent them from escaping a fire because they weren't wearing proper religious dress 
(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/1874471.stm). </p>
<p>I understand, respect, and appreciate people outside of 
Islam trying to be open-minded about this religion. But to be 
honest, sometimes it bothers me, and I think people can try 
too hard to be "politically correct," for lack of a better expression, about this topic and overlook the reality of life in Islam.</p>
<p>I'd like to reassert my argument that Muslim countries 
heralded as being more liberal are not following Islam as 
strictly. Any Muslim country that affords, for example, a 
woman's testimony in court the same worth as a man's testimony, is not actually following the Qur'an: one male witness = two female witnesses (http://quran.com/2/282). The 
same holds true for countries where polygamy is illegal, and 
in most cases for any Muslim who affords a female heir the 
same inheritance as a male heir (http://www.irf.net/).</p>

<h3>chinese culture</h3>
<b><h2>Do the Chinese people currently 
consider Mao Zedong to be evil or 
a hero?</h2>
Kaiser Kuo, Dabbler in history</b>
<p>"The Chinese people" are not, of course, of one mind on the 
legacy of Mao. There's a range of viewpoints, from the unreconstructed Mao worshippers who'd like nothing more than 
to bring back the days of the Cultural Revolution and who believe unequivocally that Mao was a hero to those who believe 
he was an unalloyed villain, a murderous monster.</p>
<p>Mao takes his place in Chinese history alongside characters like Ying Zheng, better known as Qin Shi Huang, the 
first emperor of the Qin dynasty (221-209 BCe), who unified China after the long centuries of internecine strife of the 
Warring States period. Like Mao, Qin Shi Huang was ruthless and monomaniacal, but he did unify the country. Mao saw 
himself very much in this role and embraced the archetype. 
other individuals who sought to unify China through force 
of will and an amoral, single-minded focus would include Cao 
Cao, the ruler of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period that 
followed the collapse of the Han Dynasty. All three &mdash; Qin Shi 
Huang, Cao Cao, and Mao &mdash; are viewed generally with the 
same mixture of admiration and contempt.</p>
<p>If I were forced to say there's a dominant view of Mao 
among mainlanders, it would be that Mao was "good" up until 
the very early 1950s &mdash; before the Anti-Rightist Campaign got 
into full swing, and before he set China on a course toward 
collectivization. Whether or not these beliefs can be supported by fact, it's widely believed among Chinese that Mao led 
the Communist Party and its Red Army in effective resistance 
against the Japanese invaders; that they represented a morally superior vision over that offered by the Guomindang (the 
nationalist Party), a vision that championed egalitarianism, 
feminism, anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and nationalism; 
and that they allowed China to "stand up" after a century of 
abject humiliation beginning with the opium War. After 
1949, land redistribution and the Marriage Law (which was, 
by any measure, a very progressive piece of legislation) won 
them plaudits too.</p>
<p>But then, this "common" view I'm positing would suggest Mao became out of touch with reality, power-mad, and 
dictatorial. Collectivization, the calamity of the Great Leap 
Forward, the death of tens of millions of Chinese during the 
"Three Bad Years" resulting from the folly of the Great Leap 
Forward, the nearly suicidal break with the Soviet Union, and 
of course the insanity and crazed personality cult of the Great 
Proletarian Cultural Revolution all count on the opposite side 
of the ledger.</p>
<p>officially &mdash; this was the formula handed down by Deng in 
the early 1980s &mdash; Mao was "70 percent good, 30 percent bad." 
I think for most Chinese &mdash; and almost certainly for most urban, educated Chinese &mdash; the proportion of bad to good is 
probably higher than that, perhaps even the reverse.</p>

<p>Very early on, only a few months after my first television 
appearance in 1988, I was in the university cafeteria line-up 
when two American students in front of me started joking 
to each other by saying, &ldquo;Hey, are you Dashan?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your 
Chinese is almost as good as Dashan,&rdquo; etc. I laughed along 
and explained, &ldquo;Yeah, I actually get that one myself a lot, really annoying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;YoU think it&rsquo;s annoying? Hey, at least you ARe Dashan! 
Imagine how annoying it is for us?&rdquo; the American student exclaimed. I realized he was right.</p>
<p>There has always been something of a Mr. Rogers quality 
to the Dashan character &ndash; he&rsquo;s such a nice guy you sometimes 
wish he&rsquo;d make a cameo appearance in a horror movie just so 
you could watch him get ripped to shreds and then replay it 
over and over on YouTube.</p>
<p>I often say that being a celebrity or a public figure is not 
who I am, it&rsquo;s just what I do. So it&rsquo;s important to be able to 
stand aside and analyse your public image as objectively as 
possible. That&rsquo;s why I often speak of Dashan in the third person; he is me, yet he isn&rsquo;t.</p>
In short, the reasons seem to be as follows:<br/>
<font size="-1">1.</font>
<b>Overuse</b> &ndash; People are sick and tired of hearing the name 
&ldquo;Dashan;&rdquo;<br/>
<font size="-1">2.</font>
<b>Resentment (Part A)</b> &ndash; Dashan&rsquo;s not the only Westerner 
who speaks Chinese fluently; <br/>
<font size="-1">3.</font>
<b>Resentment (Part B)</b> &ndash; Being a foreign resident in China 
is not easy, and Dashan gets all the breaks; <br/>
<font size="-1">4.</font>
<b>Political/Cultural </b>&ndash; People wish Dashan had more of an 
edge; <br/>
<font size="-1">5.</font>
<b>Stereotyping</b> &ndash; The assumption that Dashan is a performing monkey. 
<p>For a more detailed discussion:<br/>
overuse</p>
<p>The number one reason seems to be simply the frequency 
with which Dashan&rsquo;s name is brought up when it comes to 
the subjects of Canada-China relations, or Westerners learning Chinese, etc.</p>
<p>There is a parallel here with the mention of Canada in 
general in China, and Dr. norman Bethune, a Canadian surgeon who died serving the Communist Revolution in China 
and was later memorialized by Chairman Mao. For decades 
now, every time Canada is mentioned in China, the memory 
of Dr. Bethune is sure to be raised. Frankly, many Canadians 
in China are sick and tired of hearing about Bethune. The 
fact is, especially in the early years of formal diplomatic relations, the &lsquo;70s and &lsquo;80s, most Chinese had never heard of any 
Canadians other than Dr. Bethune. In the early &lsquo;90s, the Canadian ambassador to China told me: &ldquo;The best thing about 
Dashan is that finally, thank God, we have a second topic to 
discuss during all those endless banquets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think Canadians probably now wish there was a third 
topic to discuss, other than Bethune and Dashan . . .<br/>
Small talk in China tends to be very ritualized, and 
Dashan has become one of those &ldquo;standard topics&rdquo; that is 
safe and culturally acceptable to discuss whenever the topics 
such as Canada, Westerners in China, or Westerners learning Chinese are discussed. In some senses, it&rsquo;s a formality that 
has worn thin and, through gross overuse, has become annoying for many Westerners. For example, having a taxi driver 
mention Dashan simply because you have given directions in 
Chinese.<br/>
Furthermore, there is a lack of other similar comparisons, 
leading to an overuse of Dashan as a role model.<br/>
When it comes to the subject of Canada, most Chinese 
still cannot name many famous Canadians. Those that are famous in China, from Celine Dion to Avril Lavigne, are not 
necessarily known first and foremost as being Canadian &ndash; 
they are international celebrities that happen to come from 
Canada. With Dashan, being Canadian has always been an 
integral part of the public image. So, even in 2012, the first 
two names that pop up when one mentions Canada are usually Bethune and Dashan.<br/>
When it comes to discussing Chinese language acquisition, Dashan seems to almost monopolize the category of 
&ldquo;successful role models&rdquo; in public discussion. Perhaps it 
wouldn&rsquo;t be so annoying if every time a Westerner opened 
his/her mouth and spoke Chinese they were then compared to 
one of a dozen different role models rather than just Dashan. 
The fact is, if you ran a poll and asked people to say the first 
name that pops into their head when you mention &ldquo;a Westerner who speaks Chinese,&rdquo; chances are &ldquo;Dashan&rdquo; would be 
well into the 90% range.<br/>
I&rsquo;m going to discuss the reasons for this further, but let 
me add a note here to say that the fact my name is frequently 
raised in public discussion is clearly a sign of my success as a 
performer and public figure, and not something I should feel 
ashamed of or try in any way to correct.</p>
resentment (part a)
<p>Dashan&rsquo;s not the only Westerner who speaks Chinese fluently.
That&rsquo;s clearly true and I have never personally claimed to <br/>
be the best. I didn't start learning Chinese until I was nineteen and still only have a B.A. in Chinese Studies. There are <br/>
a great deal of Westerners that either acquired Chinese at an <br/>
earlier age than I did, or went on to acquire much more substantial academic and professional qualifications than I have.
That being said, a reputation has been built up around <br/>
Dashan that is hard to beat. In fact, I have to work damn hard <br/>
myself to live up to it. The basis for this reputation is fairly <br/>
simple, but multi-faceted:<br/>
<b>a) </b>Dashan is on television. There are many Westerners <br/>
who speak excellent Chinese, but they haven&rsquo;t had as much <br/>
mass media exposure as Dashan has.<br/>
<b>b) </b>Dashan has been on television for over twenty-three <br/>
years and counting. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how many Westerners appear on television speaking Chinese nowadays, or <br/>
how well they do, they will always be compared to Dashan <br/>
because he was there in the &ldquo;ed Sullivan days&rdquo; of Chinese <br/>
television, when everyone watched the same shows (because <br/>
there was practically no other choice) and because he stuck <br/>
at it. There is a certain stability to the reputation that comes <br/>
from longevity, and that is very difficult to exceed in the much <br/>
more diverse mass media environment of today.<br/>
<b>c) </b>Dashan does <i>xiangsheng </i>&#30456;&#22768;, or at least that&rsquo;s what <br/>
he became famous for. Whether the reputation is deserved <br/>
or not is debatable, but <i>xiangsheng</i> is known as &ldquo;the art of <br/>
language&rdquo; and considered beyond the ability of most native <br/>
speakers, much less a foreigner who learned Chinese as a second language.<br/>
Furthermore, Dashan became famous for doing <i>xiangsheng</i> with some of the leading performing artists of the day, <br/>
and for consistently showing them up. The standard comedic <br/>
set-up for these performances pitted Dashan, the foreign student, against XXX, the senior Chinese master who was going to show Dashan &ldquo;the glories of Chinese civilization&rdquo; and <br/>
yet over the course of the skit, the master was revealed to be <br/>
a blustering buffoon who knew less about Chinese language <br/>
and culture than his foreign student. After exploiting this comedic theme n times, it&rsquo;s quite natural that Dashan would <br/>
gain the reputation for being a master of all things Chinese, <br/>
&#26080;&#25152;&#19981;&#30693;&#26080;&#25152;&#19981;&#26195;. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I eventually turned <br/>
away from <i>xiangsheng</i> &ndash; you can only exceed people&rsquo;s expectations a certain number of times before you&rsquo;ve raised the bar <br/>
too high even for these highly scripted and polished performances.<br/>
<b>d) </b>Dashan does comedy. Comedy, like the arts in general, <br/>
is something that touches people somewhere very deeply. It <br/>
doesn&rsquo;t matter how fluent you are unless you say something <br/>
people remember, and there is no easier way to be remembered (at least in a good way) than to stand up and tell a good <br/>
joke. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of different work over the years, and at <br/>
the end of a long year of hard work, you often realize that <br/>
the only thing people will remember is one line you said in <br/>
one particular skit, because it was funny. That&rsquo;s the power of <br/>
comedy.<br/>
<b>e) </b>Dashan represents or symbolizes something very powerful to a Chinese audience. I don&rsquo;t want to get too deeply <br/>
into this, because my answer is already running too long, but <br/>
let me say this: Chinese have a very complex and conflicting <br/>
view of themselves and the world at large. They have a very <br/>
strong self-identity and sense of pride, and this leads to a <br/>
strong sense of &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo; and of being misunderstood and <br/>
misaligned by the rest of the world, or the West in particular, <br/>
as well as a strong sense that they are gradually losing their <br/>
language and culture in the process of globalization. In the <br/>
face of this, Dashan represents a Westerner who appreciates <br/>
and respects China, who has learned the language and understands the culture, and has even become &ldquo;more Chinese than <br/>
the Chinese.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a very powerful and reassuring image that <br/>
appeals to very deep-rooted emotions. <br/>
So it doesn't really matter how fluently one speaks Chinese, because in the end it&rsquo;s not a language competition. Skill <br/>
is rational, but Dashan also relates to the audience on an emotional level.</p>
resentment (part B)<br/>
Being a foreign resident in China is not easy, and Dashan gets 
all the breaks.
<p>This is true too. From my perspective, I wouldn't say that 
I&rsquo;ve gotten all the breaks and everything has been easy for 
me, but I understand the perception. Chinese tend to think 
that foreigners get such preferential treatment in China, 
what could they possibly complain about? But it is true: it 
is difficult day-in, day-out to be a long-term foreign resident 
of China. It is also exceedingly difficult to make a living as a 
foreigner in the Chinese media, as an actor, television host, or 
whatever. I&rsquo;ve done pretty well on balance. </p>
<p>Part of this resentment also comes from the perception 
that Dashan has raised the Chinese language bar too high. 
no matter how hard you work over how many years, you just 
never get to the top. Believe me, I understand this completely 
because I&rsquo;ve raised the bar too far for myself. That being said, 
I think I will use the rest of my career to see if I can push it 
a bit higher.</p>
political/cultural
<p>People wish Dashan had more of an edge. This one is more 
complicated. In general, Westerners (and particularly Americans) tend to prefer celebrities (and especially comedians) 
who have an edge. Admittedly, there are no sharp edges to the 
Dashan character.</p>
<p>Part of this delves into the political realm, where resentment stems from the wish that Dashan used his public person 
to be more politically active.</p>
<p>Let me deal with both aspects.<br/>
Culturally, the Dashan character does tend to be quite Canadian. We&rsquo;re just not as aggressive in general as Americans. 
The adjective most used to describe Canadians is &ldquo;nice.&rdquo; How 
dull and boring can you get?<br/>
Although Canada and America are very close culturally, 
there are some fundamental differences. Primarily, Canadians never consider themselves to be number one in anything 
apart from hockey. And although we are both relatively young 
nations built by successive waves of immigration, Canadians 
have a much weaker self-identity than Americans. We don&rsquo;t 
have a strong mainstream culture of our own, which I think 
makes us more malleable culturally. When Canadians come 
to China, we don&rsquo;t do things &ldquo;the Canadian way&rdquo; because nobody has the slightest idea what &ldquo;the Canadian way&rdquo; is. So we 
tend to adapt pretty well to different cultures.<br/>
Secondly, I work within Chinese cultural norms &ndash; the 
limits of what is culturally acceptable to a Chinese audience. 
That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you pander. You can challenge 
the norms and push limits here and there, and I believe I 
have done and continue to do that, but in large part you work 
within culturally acceptable limits. Chinese don&rsquo;t go for shock 
humor, nor do they tend to accept what is commonly accepted 
in the West &ndash; that it&rsquo;s oK to be offensive as long as you are 
offensive on an equal opportunity basis. That&rsquo;s just not part of 
the Chinese comedy or media scenes.<br/>
Also, in many instances what would be acceptable for a 
Chinese performer to say is not considered acceptable for a 
foreign performer, especially when it comes to social or political satire. even in a comedic exchange between individuals, 
you have to be aware that the audience may not perceive this 
as Character A making fun of Character B, but instead as 
Foreign Character making fun of Chinese Character, which 
goes over like a ton of bricks.<br/>
So, I work within cultural norms. This spills over into the 
political realm, because, to be honest, Chinese cultural acceptance of foreign political criticism is almost nil. In short, 
I don&rsquo;t have to worry about what government censors might 
say because Chinese audiences would never let me get that 
far anyway.<br/>
I could make a short public statement like that of Christian Bale recently or Bj&ouml;rk a few years ago. It&rsquo;s very easy to do 
and ensures you get very good coverage in the Western media. 
You go home and everyone thinks you are a person of moral 
conviction who stood up to the great Chinese monster. But 
the fact is that these kinds of statements elicit almost no sympathy whatsoever from ordinary Chinese citizens. They simply are not culturally acceptable to the broad Chinese audience. And it&rsquo;s very difficult to see what impact they have other 
than to further convince ordinary Chinese people that China 
is misunderstood and that the Western world is antagonistic 
towards China and resentful of China&rsquo;s development. What 
use is that?<br/>
As someone commented, "Looking at western media and 
literature, we see a trend for the most subversive and antiChina stances being the most popular." That is true. I would 
say that Dashan is a pop culture figure, not an underground 
artist I work in the mass media, like all pop culture figures in 
China do. If that means Dashan doesn't suit this trend in the 
western media, that's too bad.</p>
stereotyping
<p>The assumption that Dashan is a performing monkey. Peter 
Hessler is one of my favorite American writer of books on 
China, but he did a real hatchet job on Dashan in his book 
&ldquo;River Town&rdquo; where in the same passage he admits that he&rsquo;s 
never seen any appearances, but then concludes that Dashan 
is a performing monkey. There was no justification or explanation given.</p>
<p>I do understand where this perception comes from, and 
it's closely linked to the comedic formula I described in <b>part 
2c</b>. Successive comedic skits in which Dashan consistently 
"showed up" his Chinese teacher led us to explore more and 
more ways in which my character could exceed the teacher's 
(and hence the audience's) expectations. This led to a formula under which Dashan was constantly being tested for 
his knowledge of Chinese culture or skill in the Chinese language, and typically ends with the same conclusion: Teacher 
says, "Wow, I can't believe it," and the audience applauds.</p>
<p>However, I think to label this as being a "performing monkey" is an oversimplification that reflects a particularly Western bias and that doesn't stand up to serious analysis.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the performances are designed for 
a Chinese audience. To be a successful comedian, you have 
to have a clear understanding of audience perception, even 
if you are making an ass of yourself. You have to understand 
why audiences are responding to your material. In over twenty years of performing, I have never felt that the Chinese audience's approach to Dashan is: "This guy is a funny monkey; 
let's make him dance." That's just not how Chinese audiences 
see the character. The "performing monkey" label is something that comes exclusively from Westerners.</p>
<p>This even borders on racism in more extreme cases. The 
logic seems to go like this: white guy &ndash; speaks Chinese &ndash; Chinese people laugh &ndash; he must be making an ass of himself. of 
course, the only way a white guy could possibly entertain a 
Chinese audience would be to be a complete buffoon.</p>
<p>In some cases, this perception again seems to be based on 
resentment. Dashan is perceived as being successful. others 
may be prone to ask: "Why him and not me?" The natural conclusion: Dashan must have sold out and stooped to all sorts of 
things that I would never do. It's a psychological reaction that 
doesn't require any evidence or serious analysis, and appeals 
most strongly to those foreigners who have been the least successful in China.</p>
typical foreigner<font size="-2">?</font> poster Boy<font size="-2">?</font>
<p>Several comments mention Dashan as representing Chinese 
people's perception of the "typical foreigner." I don't think 
that's true either.</p>
<p>All cultures have their own stereotype of the stupid, bumbling foreigner. (Manuel in &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo; is my favorite 
example.) no matter where you come from, foreigners are 
often perceived as speaking your native language poorly, as 
being out-of-touch, clueless, and inept. That's certainly not 
Chinese people's perception of Dashan.</p>
<p>In fact, one way of explaining the Dashan character is 
that it&rsquo;s the flip-side of this universal stereotype: at first glance 
he was seen as the typical foreigner, but over time developed 
the reputation for being &ldquo;more Chinese than the Chinese 
are.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the whole root of the comedy.</p>
<p>This may have developed into a new stereotype of its own, 
the typical China Hand or "Friend of China," but you can&rsquo;t 
claim that Dashan represents the stereotypical token foreigner, or the stereotypical foreigner in general. If that were 
true, how on earth would Dashan ever be differentiated from 
the multitude of token foreigners and stereotyped role players 
that appear in the Chinese media?</p>
<p>I think in general, a lot of the anti-Dashan sentiment 
stems from the fact that Dashan is by far the most famous 
Westerner in the Chinese media, and as such is often perceived as the poster boy for this group in general.</p>
<p>For my part, all I can say is that I do my own thing and 
take responsibility for that. nobody forces me to do anything, 
and I have a lot of control over what I will and will not do. 
So judge me on my own record. I don&rsquo;t represent anybody but 
Dashan. I'm open to criticism or a critical discussion about 
Dashan, but it should be based on what I've actually done, not 
just some vague and uninformed perception of what people 
think Dashan might have or must have done.</p>
<p>A long answer, but I think I covered the main reasons and 
offered my own personal defense.<br/>
And, no, I don't eat children (human children, at least).</p>

<h3>indian diaspora</h3>
<b><h2>How do Indians feel when they go 
back to live in India after living in 
US for 5+ years?</h2>
Navin Kabra, Returned to India after 8 years in the US.</b>
<p>(Quick background: I grew up in India, went to US at twentyone to study. Spent eight years there, including three years 
working. Moved back to Pune, Maharashtra, India in 2001, 
and have been here ever since.)</p>
<p>A lot of how you feel depends upon the attitude. Some 
things are going to be as bad as you remember them, some 
things are going to be worse than you remember, and some 
things are going to be surprisingly better. The right attitude 
is to focus on what is good and try to ignore the bad. Some 
people fail miserably at this, and move back to the US after 
about an year. others succeed in this and love being here.</p>
Here are the things you might notice, conveniently categorized:<br/>
general life
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Yes, it is dirty, and dusty. People litter and spit and urinate 
in public. It was always like this, so you shouldn't let it 
bother you. If this is going to irritate you, don't come back.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Yes, there is corruption. But if you're going to be doing a 
job (as opposed to doing your own business), you will not 
be exposed to much of it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Most vendors and service providers are unreliable. They 
won't come on time. They will not deliver on time. Quality 
will be lacking. Some will disappear without warning you. 
This continues to bother me, even after ten years here.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
However, note that consumer-oriented business works far 
more efficiently now than it used to ten to fifteen years 
ago. When I first landed up in Pune, Maharashtra, India 
in 2001, I had nothing other than a passport. no friends, 
no family, no address proof, no ration card. no place to 
stay, no vehicle. I managed to get a rental apartment, a 
ration card, a landline phone, a mobile phone, two "gas" 
cylinders, a computer, two internet connections, a car, all 
household appliances, and start a full-time home office in 
two weeks. I would not have thought that it was possible 
to get this done in India so fast. See footnote[1] for a illustrative anecdote.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Getting domestic help is ridiculously cheap, so expect to 
have a person to do the dishes, someone else to do the 
cleaning and the laundry, and a cook, and a driver. In the 
last ten years, I've probably done dishes, or the laundry 
less than five times. My wife and I cook only when we're in 
the mood for cooking, otherwise we don't have to. I know 
that some people are thinking: "I like doing all the chores. 
There is a satisfaction in being self-sufficient." But the fact 
is that I have not seen anybody hold on to such a resolve in 
the face of easily available domestic help. (note: Driving 
is an exception. People who like to drive often will make 
do without a driver. I like to drive, so did not use a driver 
for the longest time. But these days, if I need to go somewhere that's more than twenty minutes away, I take the 
driver along, so I can get some work done along the way.)</p>
cost and standard of living
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
In general, you will be comfortably well off in India. Your 
Indian salary will be much lower than your US salary in 
dollar terms, but will be pretty good in terms of purchasing power parity. Some things will seem very expensive 
relative to your salary, and other things ridiculously cheap.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
expect to be shocked by real estate prices. Houses/Flats 
(aka "condos") in the better localities (i.e. the kinds of 
places nRIs like to live in) can be more expensive than 
houses in the US (of course, if you're not from the Bay 
Area). A major chunk of your salary will go towards the 
eMI for your home loan.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
iPads, laptops, latest flat screen TVs will seem a little expensive to you. The prices in India are just a little higher 
than US prices, (and many people buy in the US), but 
your salary will be lower.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Food, eating out, domestic help, and in general everything 
else will be much cheaper.<br/>
infrastructure:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Roads/Traffic/electricity/Water is an area that I view 
with a bit of a concern. Depending on where exactly you're 
living, one or more of these might be an irritant already, 
and the problem is likely to get worse.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Power cuts are a problem in some cities (mostly during 
the daytime). This is not an issue for employees of large 
companies, because of generator backups, but it has begun hurting smaller companies. Sometimes, you end up 
losing a few hours of work on one day of the week because 
the load-shedding extended farther than your UPS and 
laptop batteries could last.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
While water is theoretically a problem, most of you are 
likely to live in apartment complexes which buy water by 
the tanker to make up for any shortages, so you're unlikely 
to notice this much.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Traffic and commute times are becoming problems for 
some people in some cities &mdash; but then people who've lived 
in the US would not be strangers to long commutes and 
rush hour traffic jams.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Phone coverage and internet bandwidth is not really a 
problem. While the average "home" broadband network 
might not be as fast as what you're used to in the US, and 
there are sporadic reliability issues, quality, and speed are 
available at a cost if you really want them. And I'm willing 
to bet that mobile network coverage is better than what 
AT&amp;T has in the US.</p>
recreation
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 As far as shopping is concerned, (almost) everything is 
available here. electronics goods are maybe a little more 
expensive than in the US, but there is nothing that is difficult to get.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 If you're in a metro, or even Pune, there is now lots of 
international cuisine. of course, not as much as in the 
US, but certainly much more than was available five or 
ten years ago. Italian, Korean, Japanese, Mediterranean, 
French, Thai are all available in Pune, for example. McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Subway, California Pizza Kitchen, 
are all here too. And the Indian food here is far better 
than the Indian food in the US.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Multiplexes have mushroomed and have improved the 
movie-going experience, but they still remain a little more 
crowded than what I'd like.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Many "western" activities are now available here. Bowling, Paintball, Pool, Hard-Rock Cafe, and Microbreweries are all available. Quality is lower than ideal, and there 
are only one or two of each per city.</p>
kids
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Schools are getting better. There are now lots of options 
available. The old-style, regimented convent schools continue to go strong, but in addition now there are lots of 
newer schools who are willing to experiment with teaching methods. So there are lots of choices (but be prepared 
to spend a little).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Lots of options for co-curricular and extra curricular 
activities. All kinds of classes are available at reasonable 
rates.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
If you have teenage kids, remember that social mores and 
standards of what is acceptable and permissible behavior 
are changing rapidly. So if you're coming back to India 
because "my kids will grow up in a more conservative culture," you're in for a surprise. Don't say I did not warn you. 
Dealing with teenagers doesn't become any easier just because you're in India.</p>
career
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
If you are a techie in the IT industry, and if you want to 
be an individual contributor, then you will certainly not 
get as good work here as you would in the US. There are 
some companies doing interesting stuff, but as your seniority increases, your options decrease. Since most of the 
customers are in the US, there is definitely a glass ceiling.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
If you're a manager, then India is a great place to be. The 
numbers of people and projects to manage keep increasing, the challenges interesting and varied. This is an exciting place to be.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 If you are the entrepreneur type, then India is like the 
Wild West. Very challenging, high chances of failure, but 
very exciting.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
For non-IT folks, I don't know the answer. Sorry.
personal life
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
As with shifting to any new place, expect to find yourself 
suddenly friendless and lonely for the first few years. It 
takes time to make good friends.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
"Involvement" of family, and extended family in your life 
will be higher than you expected. To anyone who has 
spent over five years in the US, this will seem like an intrusion of privacy. This will bother you, (especially the 
wife, if you're a couple). US is a nice safe distance away 
from the in-laws. Coming back to India removes that layer 
of protection. This can be the biggest change in lifestyle. 
Takes at least two or three years to get used to.</p>
opinion
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
overall, I find that life here is more varied and more interesting. I found life in the US to be too cut and dry, 
too regimented &mdash; all cities are similar (compared to how 
different Indian cities are). Most interactions follow set 
patterns. (Maybe it simply boils down to the fact that I 
grew up here, and hence I'll be most comfortable with this 
way of life.) In any case, I'm very happy with the decision 
of moving here.</p>
footnote 1
<p>This is a little anecdote to give an idea of how India works efficiently in some areas. on my second day in Pune, I went to 
a random shop down the street looking to buy a mobile phone 
(instrument + service). The shop-owner told me that I need a 
proof-of-residence, which I obviously did not have. He did not 
want to let go of a customer for such a minor reason, so he 
started exploring options:</p>
<font size="-1"><p><i>Do you have parents who live here? </i><br/>
no. <br/>
<i>Do you have any other relatives, an uncle perhaps? </i><br/>
no, but mother-in-law's brother does live here. <br/>
<i>Ok, will he be willing to give an affidavit to the effect that he 
knows you and vouches for you?</i></p>
<p>Yes, he will but neither I nor he have the time or the expertise 
to get an affidavit. <br/>
<i>No, Sir, don't worry. My man will get the affidavit ready, will go 
to your uncle's home, get his signature and finish the paper work.</i></p></font>
<p>So, I bought the phone instrument right away. I called up the 
uncle-in-law and told him to expect a guy to show up with 
an affidavit to sign, and I left. By that evening, all of this had 
been taken care of, and my mobile phone service had started.</p>

<h3>travel and tourism in india</h3>
<b><h2>Is it safe for a single American 
woman to travel in India?</h2>
Adrianna Tan, I'm a fake desi</b><br/>
Absolutely. Many women do. I have traveled alone to India 
over twenty times. To all parts. 
<p>I used to always stay in $2 rooms alone and also traveled 
sleeper class in long train journeys alone. <br/>
You need to have your wits about you, more so as a lone 
woman, but this is true of all places if you have traveled alone 
before. <br/>
I'm not saying nothing untoward will ever happen, just 
that the most I have seen has been verbal harassment, which 
was quite easy to disarm. And that this did not happen significantly more than other places I have traveled to alone, and I 
will include Yemen, Bangladesh, some parts of western europe in that list. You will have some trouble traveling alone 
anywhere &mdash; I don't think India is a special case in any sense. <br/>
Someone told me, very early on when I first started exploring India alone, when in doubt, talk to a woman. I thought he 
was nuts, but then I tried it whenever I felt unsafe anywhere 
(this has happened just a handful of times). People in India 
are super friendly, so don't be afraid to ask. It should not be 
too hard to find english-speaking local women who can help, 
as they deal with much worse on their own. I realized this 
person was absolutely right: Indian women got me out of situations with calm ferocity, each and every time. They would 
tell the guy(s) to f*** off and made sure they delivered me to 
safety. This has happened across India, and I urge you to consider this if shit ever hits the fan (it shouldn't).<br/>
Some things to note, from anecdotal experiences (all of 
this has happened to me):</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
A generalization: you will probably find South India very 
safe compared to north India. If interested, ask some locals on their opinions on why that is. My experience is 
just that in south India people are more reserved and less 
taken by the idea of anything foreign. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Many people in India are unable to comprehend why you 
should want to do that. Many of my friends there who 
come from privileged backgrounds are not even given the 
opportunity to travel alone the same way I did. Most of 
their parents thought I was mad, and thought their country extremely unsafe. I think as a foreigner, one is held 
to a different set of standards, and you can see India in a 
completely different way. Don't be put off or scared by stories of other people's opinions. Discover India for yourself 
and never be afraid of her. There's a lot to learn. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You will be asked endless questions about your personal 
life. What is your good name, what is your country, how 
old are you, are you married, how many children do you 
have, do you like India, what is your native place, how 
much money you make, and can you help them get a job 
in your native place. Be friendly, be open to making stuff
up ("the correct/expected answers") if you like. It doesn't 
really matter. But do not take this personally: this stuff is 
expected, considered good form, and not intrusive at all. 
They will also want you to send their regards to your parents, who they haven't and will never meet, just keep it all 
in good faith. Friendliness takes you far in India. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
An unpleasant quirk of traveling as a lone female: this is 
a strange, not very nice thing but you will find out that in 
some places, some local men will assume because you are 
a foreigner, you are willing and able to have sex with them 
because all foreign women are not Indian and therefore 
impure and loose by definition. You won't hear this said, 
but it is thought by many. I have found this attitude more 
pervasive in the north than anywhere else. I have seen 
and heard and experienced this behavior personally from 
lowly educated men and highly educated men alike. Remember, most local men are GReAT. It's a couple of bad 
eggs that spoil it, as always. Just remember this terrible 
idea comes from watching tv and never having interacted 
properly with foreigners and believing in the myth that all 
white (and foreign women) are interested in alcohol and 
sex (and necessarily with them). Many people also won't 
be able to understand why your husband or boyfriend is 
okay with you traveling alone. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
In general, the "holier" the place, the more shit you will 
get as a single lone female. The negative stuff I've experienced have come exclusively from the touristy and/or 
holy cities/towns. no problems at all outside these parts. 
There's a crap ton of hypocrisy in the so-called holy places. 
All the sexual harassment I have ever faced has come from 
weird men in "holy" places. Luckily, none of it was ever 
dangerous, just annoying. </p>
So, be on your guard but make sure you don't let any kind of 
fear cripple your trip either. 
<p>I mean, I have more than survived India alone, and I also 
have a lot of female friends who have traveled India alone 
many times over the way I do. Their experiences more or less 
corroborate with mine. </p>
<p>The assumption is that you will dress appropriately and 
be sensitive to local customs. You will be fine. More than 
fine. Make plans before hand to meet some prominent local 
people in major cities, especially if they are in a similar field 
of work or working in an area you are interested in finding 
out about. I've learned a lot from talking to journalists, artists, tech types. They can teach you a bit about their city, and 
they will also watch out for you as you are a guest of Mother 
India's after all!</p>

<h3>investing</h3>
<b><h2>If developing countries are growing 
faster than developed countries, 
why wouldn't you invest most of 
your money there?</h2>
Yair Livne, Econ PhD from Stanford GSB</b>
<p>Investing in developing countries carries some specific risks 
that may deter the average investor from allocating the majority of their portfolio to investments in those countries. 
These risks translate into lower risk-adjusted RoI than what 
the country's growth rate might suggest, which explain why 
these kind of assets do not make up majority of most recommended portfolios. This is a partial list:</p>
<p><b>Regulatory risk</b>
 - in many developing countries investment carries risks relating to government and the rule of law. 
This can take many forms:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Nationalizing foreign investment</b>: countries like Venezuela have nationalized foreign investments in their countries, or severely tax those. This can virtually wipe out an 
investment overnight.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Arbitrary or unexpected taxation</b>: for example, the Indian government just last week proposed a retroactive tax 
on foreign takeovers of Indian assets, mainly targeting 
Vodafone which has been in dispute with the government. 
This specific move may not be directly related to personal 
investment in developing markets, but is a good example 
of how unpredictable the tax environment can be in such 
markets. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Corruption</b>: governments and related bureaucracies may 
be very corrupt, requiring bribes to allow business to operate smoothly. This will take a toll on the investment, just 
like a tax.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Weak or biased legal system</b>: say the target of your investment cheats you as an investor or you end up involved in 
a legal procedure as investor. often, your position is there 
is very different than what you would expect form a court 
in a developed country. It may be much easier for the local firm to avoid compensating you, disappear with your 
money etc.</p>
<p><b>Instability</b>
 - beyond mere regulatory risks, many developing 
countries live in unstable areas, or are still actively involved in 
internal and external conflict. Revolutions, coups, and wars 
can and will happen in some of these countries over the lifetime of your investment, which will take a toll on returns.</p>
<p><b>Underdeveloped financial markets</b>
 - in many developing 
countries the available portfolio of investment (as the question suggests) is not necessarily representative of the country's 
economy. This is often due to economies where most companies are not public (or even government-owned). This makes 
an investor's ability to track an economy's growth difficult.</p>
<p><b>Lack of information/Weak regulatory environment</b>
 - 
even when financial markets exist, they might often be underregulated or misregulated and may not resemble ones in developed countries. Accounting standards may be weak, fraud 
prevalent, or like in China's case, the government might be 
actively encouraging firms to hide negative information about 
their performance. All of these hinder an investor's ability to 
construct a reasonable portfolio.</p>
<p><b>High-correlation across markets</b>
 - despite the seemingly diverse geographical location of fast-growing developing 
economies, the reality in today's ultra-linked markets is that 
returns are highly correlated across economies. Thus, much 
of the diversification that such investments used to offer is no 
longer there.</p>
<p><b>FOREX risk</b>
 - any investment in a foreign market exposes you not only to risks associated with that particular investment but also to the risk coming from investing in another 
currency. Assuming that you want your returns in US dollars, 
you are essentially also betting on the exchange rate when investing in a foreign company. This risk is dramatically higher 
when the investment is in a developing economy. Hedges can 
be used to limit exposure to this risk, but that insurance costs 
money, and cuts into returns from the investment.</p>

<h3>north korea</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to visit North 
Korea?</h2>
Ryan Romanchuk, I have bowed before Kim Il Sung</b>
<p>north Korea does not identify with the terms north Korea 
and South Korea, and they find it offensive when referred to 
this way. When talking about the conflict with Seoul, they 
refer to them as "the South." The South is essentially still part 
of Kim Il Sung's DPRK but have been occupied by the US 
Imperialists.</p>
<p>I want to leave my opinions out of this. Probably impossible to do, but I thought a more ethnographic approach would 
be more interesting. I'm not saying you should stop calling 
north Koreans, north Koreans. My purpose of the above 
was to explain why I use DPRK in context of being inside of 
north Korea as a guest, not as an apologist or a demand for 
the west to start yielding to north Korea's feelings.</p>
<p>I recently got back from a trip to the north Korea. To be 
honest, it makes me uncomfortable to even answer this question for a couple of reasons. I had an amazing experience and 
our guides were fantastic people. It makes me a bit nervous 
to openly discuss this publicly in fear of "bad mouthing" their 
job and their country.</p>
<p>I entered on official tourism for three nights four days flying Air Koryo on the extremely limited schedule in Beijing. 
For Americans, the only options for entering the DPRK are 
by air only through China and Vladivostok, Russia, which 
only operates one flight on Thursdays. Citizens from other 
countries are allowed to take various train routes as well. 
You can only get approved for a visa four days before your 
departure. This means essentially flying to China and crossing 
your fingers. It is very rare for the average person to get denied. The things that can get you denied include living in the 
"southern" part of Korea or being a journalist. It's interesting 
to note that there is no record of me ever going to the DPRK 
in my American passport; they provided their own booklet.</p>
things that stood out
<p>I figured our guides would be the elites of Pyongyang and 
basically have been trained on how to deal with "Westerners." I also thought this means they would essentially know 
everything that we knew to better "accommodate" our needs. 
I assumed that they knew about the opinions we held and had 
access to the same information outlets. </p>
<p>I was very wrong. I was probably right that they in fact are 
elites in Pyongyang, and they have the best grasp of the english language. However, they only receive news once a week. 
The week I was there, they heard about the US Imperialists in 
Libya (they had no idea Gaddafi was dead) and that a bunch 
of wild animals got loose and were all shot. It was pretty obvious that although we had BBC in our rooms, not even our 
guides had access to this channel. I'm not exactly sure how 
they controlled this from internal hotel staff. During my trip, 
I was a firm believer the more comfortable our guides felt 
with us, the better our trip would be. We *only* asked vanilla 
questions, always asked permission before taking photos, etc. 
It was pretty easy to get answers without having to ask our 
own questions. I remember when my guide asked me, "Have 
you ever had pizza before?"</p>
<p>Part of the custom of visiting the DPRK is bringing a gift
for your guides from your home country. I thought it would be 
really cool to bring my guide an iPod shuffle with music that 
represented America. I debated what I should put on it (What 
would be the most valuable type of music to a DPRK guide 
in Pyongyang?) and ended up with the top 100 Billboard hits. 
Turns out my guide had never heard any other type of music 
besides Korean and a little music from some of the American 
movies she saw. She didn't know the titles of what she has 
seen, but one of them was about a "girl who would sing and 
dance on top of the bar." (<i>Coyote Ugly</i>?)</p>
<p>I spent a good part of the three-hour drive to the network 
DMZs explaining some of the genres like country, rap, and 
rock that were included in her mix. We shared earbuds as I 
blew her mind with the latest eminem and Lady Gaga hits of 
2010. I was pretty sad when she asked me to turn the volume 
down on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>After the first day, our guides were asking us most of the 
questions. This was actually the most stressful part of the trip. 
Some of the questions were extremely direct and impossible 
to answer honestly. "Do you have the gays in the US?" "Why 
would Gadafi's people try to kill him?" "How many countries 
have you been to?" We immediately tried to dodge these questions and ask something about a statue we were looking at 
or an aspect of Juche idea. I feel guilty for doing this because 
they started catching on to our diversions, and I could sense 
their disappointment that we weren't being very open. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest mistakes I made was going to 
sleep instead of accepting an invite to go bowling with my 
guide and their friends at the hotel 'off the clock.' It was probably one of the best opportunities I had to honestly interact 
with my guides after a few drinks. We were so tired after the 
DMZ that we crashed hard as soon as we got back to the 
hotel.</p>
<p>The only car on the street was our own. Driving outside of 
Pyongyang requires constant checkpoints. There are military 
soldiers just standing along the road the entire way to our trip 
to Kaesong near the DMZ. </p>
they really hate the u.s.
<p>By and large one of the biggest themes in DPRK is the universal hatred for the United States. on billboards, on monuments, eVeRYWHeRe. This is not a hyperbole. Watching 
the informational video on the USS Pueblo (the US spy ship) 
ended with " . . . and that's why we must annihilate the US Imperialists." Awwwwkward. </p>
<p>The fact that we were Americans visiting the DPRK on 
friendly terms made us "rebels," and we were the "crazy ones" 
who came on a fact-finding mission to seek the truth about 
north Korea. All of the Koreans we interacted with (not once 
did I interact with a civilian) seemed to really appreciate this 
fact and were thrilled to teach us about the DPRK.
reunification</p>
<p>According to our guides, reunification was something both 
the "South" and "north" wanted, but is prevented because of 
US Imperialist aggression. From what I could tell, citizens 
in Pyongyang believe that life in Seoul is not different from 
life in Pyongyang, and this horrible situation is due to US 
aggression.</p>
<p>outside of Kaesong, we were taken to a military lookout 
point so we could see the concrete wall that the US Imperialists built to prevent reunification. Below is a painting of said 
concrete wall. The legend on the right has a bunch of facts 
basically representing the amount of resources used for this 
anti-reunification wall. The military officer explained how 
said resources could have have been used by the Korean people productively, which is ironic after seeing large concrete/
marble structures dedicated to Kim Il Sung.</p>
<p>He is everywhere. He's on the wall, he's on the ground, 
he's in the air, he's on (is) the statues, the papers, the TV. This 
is one aspect of the DPRK that Westerners get wrong or have 
a general misunderstanding about. We hear a lot about Kim 
Jong Il in the west, and we mistakenly refer to him as the Dear 
Leader. The "Dear Leader" refers to the eternal president of 
the DPRK: Kim Il Sung. His son (and his son) can never be 
president. They are "military generals" while Kim Il Sung will 
forever remain president of the DPRK. I noticed Wikipedia 
refers to Kim Jung Il as the Dear Leader, but impression I got 
from my guide was that he is simply the general. </p>
<p>We visited the Kim Il Sung mausoleum, the single most 
sacred place in all of DPRK. The procedure for this place was 
nuts. We were taken to a waiting house which we then walked 
at least a mile underground &mdash; going up elevators, going down 
elevators. Formal dress was required and absolutely noTHInG electronic was allowed. They searched for memory cards, 
cameras, everything. After a few more elevators, we walked 
through an "air blower" to remove dust and whatnot. We 
then got to this giant marble hallway with a GIAnT statue 
of Sung. We lined up five across, walked up to to the eternal President, paused for ten seconds and bowed. We then 
walked into the next room where the body of Kim Il Sung 
was resting and bowed in the same formation from the south, 
west, and east sides of the eternal President. </p>
food
<p>They fed us so much food I almost delivered a kimchi baby 
by the fourth day. We had a variety of Korean food including 
Korean BBQ, bipbimbap, hot pot, and a local specialty called 
"Pyongyang cold noodles." our meals usually included many 
courses, and most of the time brought out by candlelight as 
we experienced blackouts almost every night when we had a 
meal planned outside of the hotel. It was also probably the 
best service I have had in the world. We usually had about 
three people waiting on us to make sure our glass of beer was 
filled to the top.</p>
misc. oddities
<p>Probably the most controversial stories I have about my trip 
happened in the very beginning and at the very end. The first 
thing I did after arriving Pyongyang was to take the metro for 
one stop. It was just the end of a busy work day and the metro 
was packed with Koreans going home for the day. The station 
was beautiful &mdash; reminded me a lot of a typical Moscow metro 
station. After a few trains went by, we found seats on a lessthen-full car. As we sat down, there was a very, very young 
Korean girl singing and reading music across the seat from 
where I sat. It was a very special experience.</p>
<p>on the plane back to Beijing, my friend Adam sat next 
to another American who was there the same time we were. 
He said he was a US Air Marshal and then proceeded to 
show Adam pictures he took of alleged listening devices he 
discovered in his hotel room. I read a lot of discussions about 
this sort of thing before going, and it's probably pretty easy 
to speculate anything just to make things feel more interesting. I just thought of it as *very* high-touch customer service. 
Think Zappos, with less privacy. I think there would be less 
speculation if the fifth floor on the elevator wasn't missing at 
the hotel. People find their way to the floor . . . and, well . . . you 
can judge for yourself.</p>

<h3>irish people</h3>
<b><h2>What are some common 
stereotypes about Irish people that 
are largely untrue?</h2>
Domhnall O'Huigin, Irish native. </b>
<p>Unfortunately, as regards the most common stereotypes, I 
must challenge the premise of the question; that <i>any </i>of these 
are 'largely untrue'.</p>
<p><b>1. Common stereotype:</b>
 The Irish are all drunks!<br/>
<b>The reality:</b> no, we're not! no, we're not! er . . .<b> at least not 
compared to those dipsos, the Austrians and Estonians! </b>[1]. 
<i>Crazy </i>for the hooch those guys. </p>
<p>"But Ireland has the highest proportion of non-drinkers 
per capita!"<br/>
Find me a single<i> recent </i> study to support this oft-quoted 
contention. Please, I'm begging you: I want to shove it down 
peoples&rsquo; throats too. But if it was once true, it isn't any longer. 
Possibly fueling the longevity of this urban legend is the fact 
that the Catholic alcohol abstinence movement, <b>The Pioneers</b>
(not to be confused with various youth organisations in former Communist countries, well, not much at any rate), was 
formed in Ireland [2].<br/>
Furthermore, anecdotal evidence conducted through the 
lens of the bottom of my pint glass tells me that even when 
other, larger countries (e.g. France) drank more than us (in 
2000 for example), their <i>pattern </i>of drinking was completely 
different. To continue with France as an example, French 
adults would typically drink alcohol every day, but this is a 
glass of wine with lunch, another with dinner and so on. Irish 
people may not, as a rule, drink every day, but we 'save up' 
and go mental at the weekend or special occasions. This accounts for the 'paradox' of how some countries can approach 
our level of consumption without our reputation for excess 
&mdash; they drink as a civilised, adult pleasure, to be enjoyed in 
moderation; we drink like it was going out of fashion. <br/>
Don't believe me? Want more citations? Here are some 
public Dublin webcams [3]. Log on to any of them, <i>any</i> of 
them at, say, 03:00 on a Friday night/Saturday morning and 
watch the mayhem and madness. <br/>
<i>Verdict: TRUE. </i></p>
<p><b>2. Common stereotype:</b>
 The Fighting (&ldquo;foightin&rsquo;&rdquo;) Irish. 
<b>The reality:</b> Ireland is a remarkably violent country. For example, the U.S. has a violent crime rate of 429.4 per capita 
[4]. Ireland has an assault rate of 347.9 for the same period 
[5]. "But that's great! Almost ten points less violent than the 
U.S.! Well done, the Irish!" Yeah. Until you consider the following two facts: </p>
<p>i. no guns (or very, very few) in private ownership in Ireland. <br/>
ii. The Irish figure above is for assault <i>only</i>, whereas the 
U.S. figure is for all violent crime (e.g. including homicides, 
excluded from the Irish figure) &mdash; the two countries simply do 
not record crimes in the same way, due to different legislation 
in each jurisdiction. <br/>
<b>Anecdotal supporting evidence: </b><br/>
The [old fashioned] U.S. slang for a brawl is called a "Donnybrook" [6], after the location in Dublin [7] where faction 
fights took place in the 19th century. </p>
<p><font size="-1">Donnybrook was once the location of Donnybrook Fair, a fair 
held from the time of King John onwards, which became notorious for drunkenness and violent disorder. </font></p>
<p>Spotting a theme here perhaps?<br/>
<b>Anecdotal supporting evidence II: This Time It's Serious. </b>
The common theme is of course alcoholic excess+violence. </p>
<p>The inter-relationship here is well established, especially in 
Ireland, somewhat the "patient zero" for researchers in this 
field [8]. </p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
76% of all rape defendants had been drinking at the time 
of the alleged offence.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Alcohol has been identified as a contributory factor in 
97% of public order offenses as recorded under the Garda 
PULSe system.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
one in eleven, or approximately 318,000 of the full adult 
population, said that they or a family member were assaulted by someone under the influence of alcohol in the 
past year.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Almost half of the perpetrators of homicide were intoxicated when the crime was committed.
<p>So the question remains, are we violent when we 
<i>aren't</i> pissed? 
This is more difficult to answer, and not only because I don't 
remember (because I was pissed). Well . . . we've been fighting 
for our nationhood for 800+ years, although that was hardly 
our fault. It is remarkable to note however that when we ran 
out of foreign invaders to fight we had a <i>civil</i> war [9]. If we'd 
run out of Irish people to fight, I firmly believe we would have 
started fights with rocks, the ocean, the sun, and anything 
else that was looking at us funny. </p>
<i>Verdict: TRUE. </i>
<p><b>3. Common stereotype:</b>
 The Irish all have red hair. 
<i>Top of the mornin' to ye, faith and begorrah etc. etc. etc. </i><br/>
<b>The reality:</b> ok, obviously we don't <b>all </b>have red hair.
But an estimated 10% of the population [10] have some <br/>
variety of the hair that is called 'red,' way above the average. <br/>
And the highest is Scotland at 13%, and while Scotland is absolutely its own nation with a proud and unique heritage, the <br/>
fact is there isn't a lick of difference between the Scots and <br/>
the Irish; not in culture, ethnicity, etc. So in short, yes: noticeably more red-heads than lesser countries. So come over, <br/>
bring your anti-redhead prejudices too, so we can practice stereotype #2 on them, which is to say; you. <br/>
<i>Verdict: TRUE. </i></p>
<p><b>4. Common stereotype:</b>
 Irish people are all fabulously articulate, skilled wordsmiths and poets; just generally wonderful 
with language basically. </p>
<p><i>"It's a bunch of bloody rocks."<br/>
"Oh Oscar, how witty and wonderful with words you are!". </i>
<b>The reality:</b> out of all of the stereotypes in this answer, this is 
probably the most ambiguous as regards its truth. <br/>
on the one hand: oscar Wilde, Brendan Behan, Samuel 
Beckett, edmund Burke, George Bernard Shaw, W.B. Yeats, 
Patrick Kavanagh, Seamus Heaney, Seamus Deane, James 
Joyce, R.B. Sheridan, Flann o'Brien, Sean o'Casey, oliver 
Goldsmith, Jonathan Swift etc. etc. etc. etc. [11], [12]. <br/>
It is also a fact that as the underdog, and/or new immigrant to a new land, and/or being denied <b>by law</b> our language 
and education [13], we took a bardic tradition of fluency and 
story telling and gave it even more importance in our society, 
one that survives to this day. Fluency, verbal dexterity, and wit 
are premium qualities in Irish society in the 21st Century as 
much perhaps as they were in the 1st.<br/>
on the other: </p>
<font size="-1">1 in 4 Irish adults has difficulty with reading, writing, and 
maths. [14]. </font>
<p>That is a pretty damning (and damn scary), not to say shaming, national statistic. Fine, so they are including numeracy 
there but still. So don't expect the red-haired, drunken Irish 
yob who attacks you to always be able to delight you with his 
lyrical language gymnastics while doing so, as you have a 25% 
chance of getting the other kind. </p>
<i>Verdict: HMMMM.</i>
<p>Well all the Irish people you have 
<i>heard of </i>are pretty good 
with words, true but it isn't part of our DnA or anything &mdash; 
you can be Irish and be rubbish with language &mdash; you don't 
have your citizenship revoked. </p>
<p>In summary, I started answering this question fully intending to debunk all these ridiculous and offensive or lazy 
stereotypes, and I found out while researching the answer 
that they were mostly true, so I changed my mind and my 
answer and decided to challenge the premise instead (admittedly this assumes <b>my </b>common stereotypes are the ones the 
questioner had in mind &mdash; always a dangerous assumption but 
one I am willing to volunteer you for).</p>
<p>Don't let them put you off us or our country though, 
please. We really aren't drunk all the time (I'm only half-cut 
right now, for example), and we usually fight with each other 
instead of strangers &mdash; we pride ourselves on our hospitality 
(another clich&eacute; that is true: the Irish really are welcoming). 
Just leave your prejudice against red-heads at home when doing so and indulge us in our ways.</p>
Sure we're harmless really:

<h3>irish people</h3>
<b><h2>Do Irish immigrants to the Bay 
Area feel guilty for living in such an 
amazing place?</h2>
Patrick Collison, I lived in Ireland for 17 years.</b>
<p>The Irish are certainly a race somewhat predisposed to feeling guilt and compassion for just about anything[1] &mdash; and I 
find it interesting that this question is asked of <i>Irish </i>people. 
I'd love to know what the various Chinese, Indian, Russian, 
etc., immigrants to the Bay Area would say. (Is the question 
less pondered?)</p>
<p>We also have a bit of a tendency towards doleful solipsism. 
I don't know if the person who asked this question is in fact 
Irish, but it'd be quite Irish to feel guilty for <i>the other Irish</i>, 
and not, say, the 94% of the world's population that lives in a 
country with a lower GDP per capita than Ireland.</p>
<p>Admittedly, though, that kind of humanist objectivism 
only extends so far. of course almost all Irish emigrants (myself included) feel an attachment and fondness for our home 
country. And of course we're affected and saddened more by 
tribulations in Ireland than, say, Senegal.</p>
<p>But even allowing for that, Ireland remains a staggeringly 
successful country with, by global standards, an extraordinarily high standard of living. Ireland is well-run, well-educated, rich, socially cohesive, well-located, english-speaking, 
and welcoming of outsiders. Seven years ago, <i>The Economist</i>
rated Ireland the best place in the world to live.[2] This was 
based on a raft of criteria:</p>
<p><font size="-1">The main factor is income, but other things are also important: 
health, freedom, unemployment, family life, climate, political 
stability and security, gender equality, and family and community life. We feed the factors into the equation, measuring them 
using forecasts for 2005 where possible (in four cases) and latest 
data for slower-changing indicators, such as family life and 
political freedom.</font></p>
<p>Income and unemployment have obviously worsened since 
then, but not much else has changed. And even looking at 
the economic situation, things are hardly a basket-case: in the 
first quarter of 2011, Ireland's economy grew at an annualized 
1.3%, which was the highest rate since 2007, and 3x the rate 
of GDP growth in the US in the same period. The country is 
exporting more than it was before the crisis, it won't have to 
borrow before 2014, and credit default swaps on Irish debt are 
falling fast. Just a few days ago, the <i>Financial Times</i> wrote 
about "Ireland's Unexpected economic Comeback"[3]. (Die 
Welt has noticed too.[4])</p>
<p>And so the question arguably displays a third distinctly 
Irish trait: pessimism.<br/>
As can probably be inferred from the above, I don't think 
most Irish emigrants in the Bay Area feel particularly guilty. 
And although doubts over the relative severity of the plight in 
Ireland are no doubt part of the reason, I think there are at 
least two more.<br/>
The first is that where to live is <i>mostly </i>a lifestyle choice 
(bureaucratic visa misery notwithstanding), not a condemnation. People in many countries in the world are too poor or 
too unskilled to have many options for improving their situation. <i>They're</i> the ones for whom we should presumably feel 
guilt. The Irish, on the other hand, can move to any other eU 
country with almost no paperwork at all, and there are very 
few places on earth out of reach for someone truly dissatisfied 
&mdash; Silicon Valley included. (The Irish people based in the Bay 
Area weren't handpicked by fate, they just moved here.)<br/>
The second is that a significant fraction of the Irish I meet 
out here not only display the dutiful fondness for Ireland, but 
actively think about how to improve it. It seems that almost 
all my conversations with Irish emigrants eventually turn to 
"So &mdash; what could we do to make it better back home?"<br/>
More often than not (and as befits the Valley, I guess), 
they&rsquo;ve already tried a bunch of things, are working on a 
couple of projects to bring some favored aspect of the US 
to Ireland. They tend to retain much of their Irish identity. 
They openly talk about the Irish background, return home 
frequently, bring visitors to Ireland, hire Irish interns, keep 
their headquarters in Ireland, prod government ministers 
to change such-and-such a policy. Far from detaching themselves, as you might expect a guilty emigrant to do, they tend 
to proudly involve themselves in the day-to-day ups-and-downs 
of the country.<br/>
There's a long history of this, from Chuck Feeney (trivia: 
he's responsible for both Bayside Village in San Francisco and 
much of the university infrastructure in Ireland) to the guys 
behind things like Funconf and F.ounders.<br/>
I think this is a very worthy and surprisingly universal 
trait, and probably more useful than guilt.</p>

<b><h2>How valid is the implied legal 
advice in Jay-Z's &ldquo;99 Problems&rdquo;?</h2>
Ryan Lackey, Mostly harmless.</b>
<p>Fairly valid, although it depends on the state; I'm not familiar 
with the laws of 1994, and the location is unspecified, but 
from the video, possibly Brooklyn, nY. </p>
Here's my take on the song:
<p><font size="-1">The year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw<br/>
In my rear-view mirror is the motherfuckin' law<br/>
Got two choices y'all, pull over the car or (hmm)<br/>
bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor<br/>
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake<br/>
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case</font></p>
not running from the police seems like excellent advice.
<p><font size="-1">So I, pull over to the side of the road<br/>
&ldquo;Son, do you know why I'm stoppin' you for?&rdquo;<br/>
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
or do I look like a mindreader, sir? I don't know<br/>
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?</font></p>
In general, not volunteering information at a traffic stop is 
great advice.
<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;Well you was doin fifty-five in the fifty-four;<br/>
license and registration and step out of the car &ndash;<br/>
are you carryin a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are&rdquo;
I ain't steppin out of shit, all my papers legit</font></p>
<p>Unless the cop can testify to reasonable suspicion [RS] that 
the defendant is armed &mdash; in which case he can search the 
driver and immediate vicinity for weapons for self protection &mdash; you shouldn't need to get out of the car. Pushing back 
on this makes sense, if only to ensure whatever RS grounds 
would be documented, so they can get the case thrown out 
later. If the RS was invalid or not present, all evidence coming 
after that is "fruit of the poisoned tree" and discarded.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?&rdquo;
Well my glove compartment is locked,<br/>
So is the trunk in the back,<br/>
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that</font></p>
<p>Consenting to a voluntary search is never a good idea, especially if you have felony weight on you. The standard to search 
the glove compartment is actually fairly low in California, 
since it's accessible to the driver. even though it is locked, the 
tenth circuit court of appeals has found that during a protective search of the vehicle (i.e., looking for weapons with RS), 
the glove box can be searched since it being locked may not 
prevent the driver from gaining control of a weapon. [1] The 
trunk can be opened if the car is impounded, for inventory 
reasons, which is a common way to get evidence. However, a 
locked case inside the trunk will not be opened (depends on 
the state).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;Aren't you sharp as a tack! You some type of lawyer or somethin, somebody important or somethin?&rdquo;<br/>

&ldquo;Well we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes&rdquo;</font></p>
<p>A canine can only be used during a routine traffic stop if it 
doesn't unduly delay the driver &mdash; it's reasonable to walk back 
to your cruiser to get a dog, but you can't wait to call one in. 
This all goes out the window if reasonable suspicion is developed.</p>

<h3>iron man</h3>
<b><h2>In the movie <i>Iron Man</i>, could 
investors sue Tony Stark for 
acting against the interest of the 
shareholders?</h2>
Ani Ravi, JD
<p>An investor could probably sue, but it'd be a pretty tough 
fight because of demand requirements and the business 
judgment rule.</p></b>
<p>I have seen the two Iron Man movies and The Avengers, 
but in none of them is a 10-K for Stark Industries displayed &ndash; 
therefore, I'll make some assumptions about Stark Industries 
(that will also help to make this answer more generalizable). 
Let's assume that Stark Industries is a publicly-traded and 
US-listed company, headquartered in Delaware. Let's also assume that the Board of Directors of Stark Industries authorized or ratified Tony Stark's decision to stop manufacturing 
and selling weapons. Let's further assume that a shareholder 
vote to stop selling weapons was not required by the Stark 
Industries Charter or applicable law. And finally, let's assume 
that the stock of Stark Industries dropped 20% the day after 
Tony's announcement (so that our hypothetical litigious investor has a better case) [1].</p>
<p>If this happened, an investor could certainly try to sue 
Tony, claiming that he breached his fiduciary duties to the 
shareholders by exiting the weapons business. This is an uphill battle, though. Assuming that an investor were even allowed to bring a suit [2], he would then need to demonstrate 
either that Tony Stark's actions were not protected by the 
Business Judgment Rule, or that even if they were, that Tony's actions were so colossally bad that they constituted waste 
[3]. There are many good reasons to exit a profitable business 
or decline to pursue a profitable opportunity, and it is fairly 
easy to claim that an action was taken with a view towards 
long-term profit. In the case of weapons manufacture, this 
seems a pretty easy case. More egregious examples have been 
upheld, including a baseball stadium choosing not to install 
lights because the owner thought that night games spoiled 
the purity of the sport [4].</p>
<p>The other way to get around the business judgment rule is 
to allege that the corporation engaged in self-dealing &mdash; i.e., 
that the bad business decision benefited some of the directors 
and officers personally. When this is alleged, a court will look 
at the transaction closely, and if the transaction seems unfair, will reverse it or compensate shareholders. I don't think 
there's any suggestion of self-dealing in Iron Man though, unless you consider the pretty attenuated theory that Tony as 
Iron Man benefits by a dearth of weapons supplied to other 
parties.</p>
<p>I am assuming that "stop manufacturing weapons" doesn't 
mean immediately fire all employees, destroy all inventory, 
and destroy all weapons manufacturing and research facilities &mdash; I'm assuming that Stark Industries would divest the 
weapons business in a competitive auction (if it's a separable 
business), or reallocate resources over time to other manufacturing areas (if it's not). Shutting down a profitable business 
in a value-destructive way might constitute waste if it's done 
poorly enough.</p>
<p>As above, I think that this would be a pretty hard fight 
for an investor to win [5], but it is a fact-dependent inquiry, 
and we really don't have enough information from the movies to tell. If someone wants to write a sequel, <i>Iron Man 3: 
Stark Industries Derivative Litigation</i>, it'd be worth fleshing 
out the corporate governance structure of Stark Industries, 
the business units of the company, and its financials and how 
diversified they are.</p>
<p>[1] First assumption because it seems most likely and because it's more interesting for a US audience. Second one because it's much less interesting if Tony Stark makes a public 
announcement, and two days later the Board reverses it; you 
have no reason for an investor to sue. Third, like second, because it's not interesting if the decision isn't authorized (and 
because I doubt that many US companies would require a 
shareholder vote for a divestiture). Fourth because if there's 
no harm, there's no reason to sue.</p>
<p>[2] This is complicated - in general when suing for breach 
of fiduciary duty, you don't sue in your own capacity, but rather you sue on behalf of the corporation (a <i>derivative</i> suit). To 
do that, you need to demand that the Board bring the suit 
first, and if they don't want to, you're out of luck. or, you can 
demonstrate with your suit that the Board is interested in the 
subject matter of the suit &mdash; i.e., you'd need to essentially prove 
that the Board engaged in an improper transaction before 
you could even get into court. The other option, which generally isn't available, is that you might be able to sue Tony Stark 
on your own behalf (a <i>direct</i> suit), but this would require that 
Tony was a majority shareholder, or if not one, someone who 
as a practical matter controlled the company (this is probably 
true), and you'd have to demonstrate that you suffered some 
particularized harm that the other shareholders of the corporation did not suffer (this probably isn't true).</p>
<p>[3] If you're the Ceo of a real estate development company, it'd be an exercise of your business judgment to decide 
to paint all the houses in your new residential sub-division 
bright green (however stupid); it'd be waste to burn them all 
down. It's pretty hard to commit waste unless you're trying.</p>

(Ill.App. 1 Dist. 1968). <br/>
[5] Though it would certainly be undertaken &mdash; every time 
the stock price of a company drops, plaintiff's lawyers in Delaware rush to the court house to file a derivative suit on contingency, which is usually settled for pennies.</p>

<h3>china</h3>
<b><h2>Is it true that in China, you can 
hire someone to serve your prison 
sentence?</h2>
Ti Zhao, Born and partially raised here</b>
<p>The short answer is: Yes, you could hire someone to serve your 
prison sentence. It's illegal and not that common, but happens enough that we have a term for it: &#39030;&#32618; (ding zui: to 
take blame for someone else's crime). While there are documented cases of body-doubles serving crimes, there is also a 
lot of speculation. As with many things, the full story is more 
complex than meets the eye.</p>
The most common questions that arise around this topic 
are:<br/>
<font size="-1">1.</font>
What kind of justice is this?<br/>
<font size="-1">2.</font>
Why would anyone be willing to give up their freedom in 
exchange for monetary compensation?
<p>It's not justice, any way you slice it. It's a sad reflection of 
the reality of power abuse, corruption, and the things that the 
wealthy and powerful can get away with. Ding zui is illegal, 
but corruption runs deep, and many in the judicial system 
(with enough bribery) simply turn a blind eye.</p>
The practice of standing in for others' crimes goes way 
back. The rationale ran like this:<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Crimes call for punishments.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Punishments are partly a display to warn other potential 
criminals against the repercussions of committing said 
crime.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The criminal, by paying for a stand-in, is &mdash; quite literally 
&mdash; "paying for his crime."<br/>
Stand-in punishments have also been, at times, an act of selfsacrifice. examples include:<br/>
<font size="-1">1.</font>
A parent serving a child's sentence, and thus allowing the 
child to have a better future.<br/>
<font size="-1">2.</font> A child serving a parent's crime, in order to provide a 
comfortable life for the parent.<br/>
<font size="-1">3.</font>
A family member serving someone else's sentence in exchange for monetary compensation for their family.
<p>These altruistic motives can still be seen today. For example, people sometimes take the blame for a family member's 
drunk-driving incident, since the punishment for a deadly accident is far more severe if the driver was intoxicated. This 
means that overall, the family spends less time is prison.</p>
<p>In other cases, there are people who willingly stand-in in 
exchange for money for their family (owing to the large income gap in China, this amount of money can often be very 
small). The family then can afford to live a life that is better 
than the one they were facing previously.</p>
<p>There is nothing just about the wealthy paying their way 
out of a crime. everyone knows that, and cases of powerabuse are often accompanied by massive public outrage, such 
as with the case of Li Qiming, who drunkenly ran over two 
girls on the campus of Hebei University. When he was finally 
stopped by security guards, his response was "Sue me if you 
dare. My father is Li Gang." "My Father is Li Gang" quickly 
became a bitter inside joke that's used to dodge responsibility in anything and everything. A contest was even started 
around incorporating the phrase "My father is Li Gang" into 
classic Chinese poems.</p>
<p>Much of this is a reflection of a society where people emphasize power over individual liberty. The sad reality is that, 
at least for now, it can be easy for the wealthy and powerful 
to get away with things that they really shouldn't be able to.</p>

<h3>attorneys</h3>
<b><h2>Why are lawyers so expensive even 
with the excess supply of lawyers?</h2>
<p>Antone Johnson, I am one, and have worked with, above, 
below, and across from hundreds of them over the past 15+ 
years.</p></b>
<p>As an economics major, as well as a lawyer who's worked in 
many different areas of the profession over the past decade 
and a half, let me take a crack at this one.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>"Sticky" wages</b>. Who likes to get their salary cut? nobody. 
Historically, most companies (both in and out of the legal 
profession) will do anything to avoid cutting salaries, even 
if that means layoffs. That's changed somewhat in recent 
years, particularly in highly volatile industries like tech 
and finance, but the legal profession is one of the slowest 
to change. This leads to:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>"Sticky" billing rates.</b> Law firm billing rates only go one 
of two directions: Up or sideways. They never go down. 
This is insane from an economics perspective. When 
demand for something evaporates as a result of, for example, the housing meltdown or the dot-com crash, basic 
microeconomics principles tell us that the price must drop 
to restore equilibrium (supply = demand). When prices 
are sticky, this doesn't happen, so you end up with a gap 
between supply and demand: overpriced lawyers sitting 
around doing nothing, and clients not getting served because they can't afford those rates. Classic "lose-lose" situation.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Limited discounting</b>. Most other industries don't like to 
cut prices either, in good times or bad. Thing is, if you're 
Cisco selling routers and switches to corporate clients, and 
demand plummets with the economy, you can authorize 
your sales force to offer deeper discounts to the highestvolume customers. In enterprise software and hardware 
deals, I'm used to seeing discounts as high as 30%, 40%, 
even 50% on occasion to get/keep the ongoing business of 
the most desirable customers. That is totally unheard of in 
the world of business law, where the deepest I've ever seen 
discounts go is 15-20%. not nearly enough for the Great 
Recession. Why is this?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Obsession with prestige and rankings</b>. Lawyers tend to be 
hyper-competitive personalities. That helps win cases and 
negotiate tough deals, but it spells trouble when it leads to 
irrational decisions. The top large business law firms ("Am 
Law 100" or "nLJ 250") are perennially obsessed with 
their respective positions in the pecking order, including 
the most common metrics (profits per partner, revenue 
per lawyer, year-over-year growth), as well as qualitative 
factors (hiring the "best" law school graduates, recruiting 
the most famous partners). How do they do this?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Money is viewed as a proxy for prestige</b>. A handful of century-old "white shoe" firms in new York, Boston, and DC 
used to dominate the business law world, but that changed 
radically in the postwar years as aggressive, entrepreneurial upstarts (often Jewish graduates of top law schools 
who were marginalized by anti-Semitism at the old firms) 
started grabbing market share and ultimately became 
some of the most profitable practices around. Regional 
firms from other cities also entered the fray, rebranding 
as "national" firms. How to recruit the most renowned, 
rainmaking partners? Make your firm as profitable as possible to attract them. How to hire the very best associates? 
Pay the highest starting salary.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Associate salaries are not an efficient, free market.</b> The 
top tier of large law firms is an oligopoly within each regional market. For many years leading up to 1996, when 
I graduated law school, all of the large new York firms 
payed exactly $83,000 starting salary, all of the LA firms 
paid $70,000, and so forth. one of a handful of the largest 
firms would decide when the time finally came to raise associate salaries (often Cravath or Skadden in new York), 
and once the new figure was announced, every other firm 
that wanted to be considered "top-tier" would move swiftly 
to match. As the most profitable legal market in the country, new York led these changes for decades, until . . .</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>The dot-com boom changed everything.</b> There was a severe shortage of corporate lawyers in Silicon Valley in the 
late 1990s as the amount of deal work exploded, with record IPo, M&amp;A and VC activity, as well as every other 
type of deal you can imagine. At the same time, the cost 
of living in the Bay Area was spiraling upward. To compound the situation, there was an exodus of lawyers (including myself) from top-tier law firms to grab in-house 
opportunities at Internet companies, lured by potential 
stock option riches as well as other factors. Firms in SF/
SV, as well as LA and other markets outside nY, decided 
they needed to increase associate pay. It started incrementally, with regional offices matching nY starting salaries 
($90-95K), until the "shot heard round the legal world" 
was fired in early 2000. The name <b>Bob Gunderson</b> became 
legendary among grateful associates as his Silicon Valley 
firm, <b>Gunderson Dettmer</b>, pushed through dramatic increases in the entire associate pay scale, beginning with 
$125K starting salaries (up from $95K the year before), 
plus bonuses. The herd followed, with all of the major SF/
SV/LA firms quickly matching the new pay scale, and of 
course new York couldn't allow the West Coast upstarts 
to pay the highest salaries, so the Gunderson scale became 
the nationwide pay scale for top-tier law firms. Who do 
you supposed paid for those huge salary increases?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Law firm overhead consists mostly of compensation.</b>
Well, that plus expensive office space in prestigious buildings, lavish summer associate programs, and many other 
little things that generally reflect an attitude of operating 
in a "costless" environment. naturally, partners weren't 
about to let their profits plummet as a result of higher associate pay. So billing rates went up and up and up, passing on the higher cost of doing business to clients. Billing 
rates roughly doubled at big SF/SV/LA firms between 
2000 and 2010, for the same people doing the same work. 
See my related blog post at http://bll.la/55 (itself a good 
read, in my humble opinion).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Back to Econ 101.</b> What happens when you double the 
price of something? Demand for it decreases. At the 
margin, buyers seek substitutes, or choose to do less, do 
it themselves, hire more in-house staff, outsource laborintensive work to India, etc. Well, not necessarily; in an 
inflationary period, you might need to increase <i>nominal</i>
billing rates to keep the <i>real</i> cost of things constant. But 
2000-2010 wasn't exactly a boom period overall, with inflation hovering around 3%.</p>
In any event, why didn't things just implode at big law firms 
after 2000?
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Things sucked for a couple years, but another bubble 
came along</b>. The dot-coms died a grisly death, but the 
housing bubble was ready to take investors for a similar 
ride; we all know how that turned out. During those years, 
there was plenty of corporate work for the big firms to do, 
especially in new York, securitizing mortgages, creating 
all kinds of funky new derivatives, and so forth. In good 
times, investment bankers basically pay whatever bill the 
law firm throws their way, so in the mid-2000's housing 
boom years, it was raining money in those areas. Bankruptcies of the enron-WorldCom nature also kept large 
numbers of lawyers busy in the early-mid-2000s, as well 
as a boom in IP litigation corresponding with the rise of 
the patent troll industry. only after the housing crash and 
the related carnage on Wall Street did things really cool 
off for big law firms. The deep freeze began around 2008.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>At large law firms, salaries and billing rates are the same 
across departments.</b> As a matter of morale, prestige, and 
camaraderie, this makes sense. As a matter of economics, it's nuts. Again, thinking of efficient markets, when 
demand for something (e.g., securitization of sub-prime 
mortgages) dries up, the price charged for that work 
should drop. When demand for something soars (e.g., corporate bankruptcy), rates for that work should rise. nope. 
For the most part, a 4th-year associate in every practice 
area bills out at the 4th-year associate rate, and so forth. 
Again, why does this matter? Go back to the points about 
sticky billing rates and sticky salaries. Both are likely to go 
only one direction &mdash; up &mdash; as long as any major area of the 
firm is doing well and can afford to raise rates along with 
demand. This works out pretty well for the firm, because 
different practice areas are cyclical or counter-cyclical and 
that helps stabilize their finances, but it's not so great for 
the clients.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? I've addressed the question of 
why (large, top-tier) law firm billing rates are so high: enormous overhead, sticky billing rates and salaries, and a general institutional insensitivity to costs until clients kick and 
scream about them. But what about that bimodal distribution 
and all of those out-of-work lawyers?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> In placement, law schools and students focus on the 
large, top-tier firms to the exclusion of most other opportunities</b>. This is because they pay the highest starting 
salaries and are prestigious names to have on the resume 
at the beginning of a legal career (see "obsession with 
prestige and rankings"). This isn't just about greed and 
status; student loan burdens can be huge (another subject) and recent graduates are rightly concerned about 
earning enough to pay them off. Particularly at top-tier 
law schools, there's a big push to land jobs at the big firms, 
and in good times, a large proportion of each class gets 
those jobs. (In bubble times, there's a bidding war over a 
fixed supply of perceived "top students" &mdash; as they say, only 
ten schools can be in the Top Ten, and only 25% of the 
class can be in the top quarter of their class.) It's always 
been the case that smaller firms, government jobs, judicial 
clerkships, and public interest jobs for lawyers pay much 
less than the big firms. But with demand shriveling up for 
new grads to staff the big, top-tier firms (perhaps related 
to the fact that said firms seem to think it makes sense to 
bill out rookie lawyers at $250+ an hour), that pushes everyone down the pecking order. Small and mid-sized firms 
usually hire a small number of associates, particularly at 
the junior level. They hire only when necessary, based on 
immediate needs, vs. planning ahead for whole "classes" of 
new associates as the big firms do.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>The middle is missing</b>. There used to be a class of midsized regional firms with billing rates and salaries significantly lower than the big national/coastal firms, but 
significantly higher than most small firms. That's mostly 
gone now, as during the good years, many of those firms 
merged with megafirms as part of the pursuit of everhigher profits (justified by the need to keep those profits 
growing to attract/retain the best partners).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>People are catching on.</b> none of this is new in 2011. The 
legendary, late Craig Johnson (no relation) founded Virtual Law Partners in 2008 based on the idea that law 
firms could do top-tier work for corporate clients at significantly lower rates by cutting overhead and operating 
more efficiently. (Shocking, I know.) As Craig famously 
said in an interview:</p>
<p><font size="-1">"The thing that makes it almost a slam dunk is the incredible 
price umbrella from the big firms," Johnson said. "When you 
charge $400 an hour and have clients think it's a bargain, how 
could you not succeed?"</font></p>
<p>See   http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202423014334
for the whole story, which is worth reading. So before stepping down off the soapbox, here's the upshot:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>The legal industry is in the midst of a once-in-a-generation disruption</b>. From the perspective of one who has 
served as a general counsel in recent years, paying $3 million a year in outside law firm bills, we (or "they" now that 
I've switched teams) are fed up with large firms' endlessly 
escalating billing rates and cost insensitivity. With many 
talented, experienced lawyers having left big firms (voluntarily or involuntarily), and technology making it easier 
than ever to set up shop as a new solo practice or small 
firm, Craig's point is compelling. I started my own firm, 
<b>Bottom Line Law Group</b>, with a similar philosophy of 
low overhead and an awareness of clients' cost sensitivity, 
in large part because I want to serve early stage startups 
and other clients who couldn't afford me if my billing rate 
were $650/hour. (See http://bll.la/55 for a manifesto of 
sorts.) Firms like mine, and those founded by many of my 
colleagues in the last couple years, are the wave of the 
future. It's such an obvious win-win &mdash; or slam dunk, as 
Craig said &mdash; that I think it's inevitable. In much the same 
way that startups seize opportunities that large corporations aren't nimble enough to pursue, "startup" law firms 
will rush to meet the market need that's currently unmet. 
The only way I see that not happening is if the megafirms 
move to slash overhead (meaning compensation, not layoffs) and billing rates. With all of the incentives and institutional traits that I've described above, I think the probability of that happening in the near future is near zero.</p>

<b><h2>What are some stupid things that 
smart people do?</h2>
Lee Semel, http://leesemel.com</b><br/>
Wow, there are so many. Here are but a few of my favorite 
stupid things smart people tend to do:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Ignoring the importance of design and style </b>- When the 
iPod originally came out, technical people complained 
about its lack of features and perceived high price ("ooh, 
who cares about another MP3 player; I can go buy one 
at Best Buy for $50." In the meantime, it was so cool and 
easy to use that normal people went out in droves to buy it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Using terrible tools, and taking pride in their awfulness</b><br/>
- especially common with programmers, who take pride 
in using programming languages and text editors that 
have been designed by programmers, not updated since 
the 1970s, and never touched by anyone with a modicum 
of design sense. They believe that mastering arcane, overcomplicated commands and processes are a mark of pride, 
rather than a waste of time. I will refrain from singling 
out specific programming languages and tools here, because smart people also like to get caught up in pointless 
flame wars about this sort of thing.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Following the pack</b> - Many smart people often seem to 
be followers, probably because they grow up spending so 
much time pleasing others via academic and extracurricular achievement that they never figure out what they really 
like to work on or try anything unique. Smart people from 
top schools tend to flock into the same few elite fields, 
as they try to keep on achieving what other people think 
they should achieve, rather than figuring out whatever it 
is they intrinsically want to do.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Failing to develop social skills</b> - Some smart people focus exclusively on their narrow area of interest and never 
realize that everything important in life is accomplished 
through other people. They never try to improve their social skills, learn to network, or self-promote, and often 
denigrate people who excel in these areas. If you are already a good engineer, you are going to get 10x the return 
on time spent improving how you relate to other people 
compared to learning the next cool tool.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Focusing on being right above all else</b> - Many smart people act as if being right trumps all else, and go around 
bluntly letting people know when they are wrong, as if 
this will somehow endear others to them. They also believe that they can change other people's minds through 
argument and facts, ignoring how emotional and irrational people actually are when it comes to making decisions 
or adopting beliefs.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Letting success in one area lead to overconfidence in others</b> - Smart people sometimes think that just because they 
are expert in their field, they are automatically qualified in 
areas about which they know nothing. For instance, doctors have a reputation as being bad investors.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Underrating effort and practice</b> - For smart people, many 
things come easily without much effort. They're constantly praised for "being smart" whenever they do anything 
well. The danger is that they become so reliant on feeling 
smart and having people praise them, that they avoid doing anything that they're not immediately great at. They 
start to believe that if you're not good at something from 
the beginning, you're destined to always be terrible at it, 
and the thing isn't worth doing. These smart people fail 
to further develop their natural talents and eventually fall 
behind others who, while less initially talented, weren't 
as invested in "being smart" and instead spent more time 
practicing. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Engaging in zero sum competitions with other smart 
people </b>- Many smart people tend to flock to fields which 
are already saturated with other smart people. only a limited number of people can become a top investment banker, law partner, Fortune 500 Ceo, humanities professor, 
or Jeopardy champion. Yet smart people let themselves be 
funneled into these fields and relentlessly compete with 
each other for limited slots. They all but ignore other areas where they could be successful, and that are less overrun by super-smart people. Instead of thinking outside the 
box, smart people often think well within a box, a very 
competitive box that has been set up by other people and 
institutions to further someone else's interests at the expense of the smart person.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Excessively focusing on comparing their achievements 
with others</b> - Smart people who have been raised in a 
typical achievement-focused family or school can get anxious about achievement to the point of ridiculousness. 
This leads to people earnestly asking questions like: &ldquo;If I 
haven't succeeded in my mid 20s, could I be successful in 
the rest of my life?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are you a failure if you are not a 
billionaire by age 30? What about 40?&rdquo; </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Ignoring diminishing returns on information</b> - Smart 
people are often voracious readers and can absorb huge 
quantities of information on any subject. They get caught 
up in reading every last bit of information on subjects that 
interest them, like investing, lifehacking, or tech specs 
of products they're planning on buying. While some information is useful in making a decision, poring through 
the vast amount of information available online can be a 
waste of time. They end up spending a lot of time gathering information without taking action.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Elitism</b> - Smart people often use smartness as measure of 
the entire worth of a person. They fail to see the value in 
or even relate with people who are different. This is illustrated by the Yale professor who doesn't have the slightest 
idea what to say to his plumber.</p>

<b><h2>What are the disadvantages of 
dating highly intelligent men?</h2>
Kat Li, </b>&hearts;
<p>As usual, a preface: I love highly intelligent men. All of my 
serious relationships have been with very smart people whom 
I respect a lot. However, I have noticed a few not great things 
that often seem to come with high intelligence (correlation 
not causation?):</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Over-competitiveness.</b> They know they're intelligent, and 
they want you to know it too. Sometimes, they'll argue 
the most inane things with you for hours on end because 
they can't stand losing a point. This can be problematic, 
because one needs to willingly concede a point (even when 
you know you're right) for the good of interpersonal relations  sometimes.  Relatedly . . .</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Egos.</b> They are used to succeeding, and so, dealing with a 
loss can be hard for them. Sulking and/or moping are not 
unheard of.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Lack of manual skills.</b> Because they've emphasized the 
brain all their lives, sometimes the brawn is lacking. They 
won't know how to change the oil of a car or build anything with their hands (that does not become a computer).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Single-mindedness. </b>Similarly to the last point, sometimes 
highly intelligent people are so intent on their one area of 
specialization that they forget how interesting the rest of 
the world is. Although they have differentiation, they lack 
a broader intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Bad teachers.</b> Being a good significant other, you may become interested in their area of expertise. You may think 
learning about it from your partner is ideal. However, be 
forewarned: sometimes, the better one is at something, 
the harder it is to explain it. As an expert, it's easy to forget how hard it is in the beginning or at which points an 
amateur may get stuck. This can lead to frustration on 
both the part of the teacher and the student.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Snobbery.</b> If you are not knowledgeable in their area, they 
can inadvertently make hurtful comments that reflect 
a disdain for your area of expertise. Watch out for this. 
Before you embark upon a serious relationship with this 
person, make sure they really respect you and what you do.</p>

<b><h2>How do you know if you've found 
&ldquo;the one&rdquo;?</h2>
Alison Stone, that's me. Just me.</b>
<p><i>This is advice I gave a younger person who said she knew she 
wanted to marry her boyfriend because she "loved him." She 
thought that being "in love" meant she had found "the one."</i></p>
<p>Are you a loving person? Because loving people are capable of loving <i>lots</i> of people in their lifetimes. You are likely to 
find many people pleasant, agreeable, exciting, and enjoyable. 
That doesn't mean you need to <i>marry</i> any of these people.</p>
<p>At some point, you may find yourself loving a person who 
is particularly compatible with you. You find your ways of 
thinking work well together. You have similar values in life. 
You have similar goals for your future. </p>
Congratulations! You have found <i>a potential life-mate.</i>
not "<b>the</b> one" by any means, but <b>a really good</b> one.
<p>Does that person feel the same way? Do you both display 
equal commitment to long-term relationships? Does your history together cover a wide range of experiences? Do you have 
a realistic idea of life together? now you have a decision to 
make. </p>
Many people phrase their decision-making like this:
<p>"This must be the right choice because I'll never find anyone else as ____ (good, special, wonderful) as this again."<br/>
oR<br/>
"This must be the right choice because I've never found 
anyone else as ____ (good, special, wonderful) as this before."<br/>
Statements like this are setting you up for disappointment! Instead, consider this:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You're likely to find other people to love.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You're likely to be compatible with some of them.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> Some of them will possibly hold even greater potential 
than the person you are with now.
<p>Ask this question instead: is your current relationship 
good enough that you are willing to take a pass on all future 
"potentially better" loves? </p>
<p>Take some time to think about this. Rest on it, pray, meditate. Picture eating breakfast with that face (aging, sagging, 
wrinkling) across the table for the rest of your life.</p>
If the answer is still a solid "yes!" then go for it. But if you 
have niggling doubts . . . give it more time.<br/>

<b><h2>How do I convince my girlfriend 
(possibly future wife) that a 
diamond engagement ring is a 
waste of money?</h2>
Dave Cheng, Happily married as of 8/2010.</b><br/>
Culture is not static. Desires are fleeting.
<p>I realize you love this woman and place her desires above 
the wants, perhaps even needs, of others, but valuing pretty 
little stones above human death and suffering is just plain 
selfish. <b>I'm sure there were people in the 1800s who thought, 
"This whole slavery thing is kind of screwed up, but, well, everyone else is doing it, life would be a lot tougher without it, 
and gee golly what would all the neighbors say if we were the 
only silly geese on the block who didn't own slaves? Guess we 
might as well." </b></p>
<p>People used to think the world was flat. Blatant racism, 
segregation, eugenics, voodoo, leeching, and a thousand other 
ignorant and harmful practices all used to be the norm. Don't 
be one of the sheep. If she asked you to jump off a bridge to 
prove your love because that's what all her friends' husbands 
did, would you?</p>
<p>Here is how I suggest trying to convince her: <br/>
First, in an objective, non-argumentative way (e.g., something along the lines of "Honey, I did a little research while 
shopping for an engagement ring and came across some horrible, disturbing statistics"), give her <b>the facts</b>:</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Conflict, aka "blood", diamonds have directly caused the 
deaths of millions;
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Indirectly, such diamonds have i) caused the death and 
suffering of hundreds of millions, ii) contributed to worldwide poverty and inequality, and iii) furthered political 
and economic instability in parts of the world that are already desperately poor and desperately unstable;<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> From the perspective of economic development, rich 
countries' demand and subsequent exploitation of the 
third world for natural resources is so toxic to such regions that in every economics class I've ever taken, we 
were taught that natural resources are a "bad" thing to 
have for a country lacking in basic infrastructure and 
political institutions. <i>A third world country discovering a 
diamond mine is like a homeless, uneducated drug addict 
discovering a bag of money on the street</i>; </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The tradition of diamond engagement rings was cooked 
up by the same kinds of people who cooked up the gift
giving rituals for Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's 
Day, Secretary's Day, Christmas, etc. with one huge difference: they did so while knowing and perpetuating the 
facts above;</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 no matter how much any diamond seller claims otherwise, there is no way for you to be absolutely sure the diamond you are buying is not a conflict diamond; </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
even if what you buy is not a conflict diamond, by paying 
thousands of dollars for it, you still fuel the market demand that created and continues to create such "conflicts;" 
and</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Science has advanced to the point where man-made diamonds are not only indistinguishable from the real thing, 
they are better. one of the red flags for a fake is if a stone 
doesn't have any imperfections. </p>
next appeal to her <b>on a personal level</b>:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
explain to her that you love her very much, and it is because of this love that you do not wish to engage with her 
in something that is morally reprehensible and utterly indefensible.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Pre-buy: If you decide to buy a diamond, given how expensive it is, you will do your research on the valuation criteria 
(the 4 C's and so on) and will shop around quite a bit. You 
will go from not being able to tell the difference between 
$5,000 and $10,000 rocks to being able to distinguish a 
$8,000 stone from a $12,000 one. Due to a combination 
of why she wants one in the first place, your love for her, 
societal and cultural expectations, and the sales pitches of 
the various oily merchants you deal with while shopping 
around, you will not only end up buying a diamond near 
the top of your spending range, your "range" will likely get 
higher during the process.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Post-buy: Sadly, after the wedding and the initial giddiness die down, the chances of her continuing to wear and 
appreciate the ring years later are quite slim. If nothing 
else, wearing a huge and valuable rock on your finger every day to work or wherever else is kind of a pain. eventually, when it comes time to buy a house or have a kid, she'll 
realize spending so much on a diamond was a stupid and 
impractical decision.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Tell her you are willing to spend just as much, if not more, 
on a better way to express your love and commitment: investments in her name, the start towards a down payment 
on a house, a trust fund for the college education of your 
future child(ren), an extension of your honeymoon, or 
even some other trivial, meaningless, superficial piece of 
shit &mdash; just one that isn't brought about by the suffering 
of others.</p>
<p>If all of that fails to sway her and if she is not even willing to 
listen, I would reconsider your engagement, and then if you 
have to, get her a zirconian and order fake Tiffany's boxes 
online to put it in. She'll never know the difference.</p>
<p>I bought my wife a diamond engagement ring because she 
wanted one and her friends and family all expected one. At 
the time, I didn't give it much thought &mdash; it was the least of 
the requisites for winning her hand. I spent a lot more than 
the two of us originally decided to. She was of course dazzled 
and delighted by my impulsive heart winning over my rational 
mind. Today however, she hardly ever wears it and readily admits it was a waste of money. I've bought a lot of useless crap 
over the years but none that I regret more than this . . .</p>

<b><h2>How do boys feel about girls 
who don't expend much effort 
on appearances (e.g., clothes, 
makeup)?</h2>
Lex Cooke</b>
<p>When I was about five years old, I used to like eating tuna 
fish salad for lunch. I didn't know how to make tuna salad; 
my mom had always made it for me, and I had always enjoyed 
it. one day, I had a babysitter looking after me. It was lunch 
time; she asked me what I wanted and I said, "tuna." It was a 
fair enough request, so she began gathering ingredients. She 
asked me what I wanted in my tuna salad, and I told her that 
I liked it plain.</p>
<p>This is when things started to get weird.<br/>
"So no celery or anything?" She asked.<br/>
"no, just plain."<br/>
She was a little puzzled but went along. "So just the mayo </p>
and tuna?"
<p>At this point, I didn't understand what she wasn't getting 
about my request; it seemed pretty simple to me. "no, literally 
just the tuna on a plate is fine," I told her (<i>probably didn't use 
the word "literally" at age five, but just go with it</i>).</p>
<p>now she was really confused. "So, you want the tuna, 
straight out of the can . . . like a cat?"<br/>
At this point, I just stared at her, blankly, for a moment. 
I had never owned a cat. I had no idea what they ate. I knew 
<i>I</i> certainly wasn't a cat. And what was this business about a 
can? I just wanted lunch. "err, uhh, yeah . . . that sounds right."<br/>
She shook her head a little and then proceeded to dump 
a can of tuna fish onto a plate and placed it in front of me on 
the kitchen table. I looked down at my lunch. It looked disgusting. I looked up at her. She looked back at me with a mix 
of curiosity and bewilderment.<br/>
For better or worse, it was in this moment that my mom 
got home and walked into the kitchen. I won't take you 
through the dialogue that ensued because this introduction is 
getting ridiculous but my mom was really confused as to why 
the babysitter had basically given me cat food for lunch, I was 
confused as to what horrible things my babysitter had done to 
make the tuna so disgusting and unappealing, and the babysitter probably thought that my mom and I were pulling some 
bizarre, psychological prank on her. It was a disaster. I don't 
think my mom ever hired her again, but years later we got to 
the bottom of what had happened when I randomly helped 
my mom make tuna salad one time.<br/>
The point is, I liked tuna salad a certain way, but I had 
absolutely no idea what kind of preparation was required to 
reach the outcome that I enjoyed. I couldn't see the individual 
ingredients and hadn't actually put much thought into how it 
was prepared, so I just sort of assumed that the tuna I liked 
was the norm, the baseline, the unadulterated way that it 
came. You could dress it up more if you wanted but I didn't 
like dressing it up. I liked it "plain."<br/>
I think most guys think about about girls putting time into 
their appearance the same way my five-year-old self thought 
about the preparation of tuna fish salad. It's something that 
we, frankly, don't put much thought into and when we do, our 
understanding of what needs to be done to achieve the outcomes that we are most fond of is so profoundly lacking that 
it is basically useless for us to give our opinions on the level of 
preparation that we prefer.<br/>
But if you're still reading, this is the actual answer I wrote 
in response to this question before remembering the tuna fish 
incident. enjoy.<br/>
Most guys don't spend much time thinking about a girl's 
clothes or makeup. If something about your appearance 
makes us think about either of those things, you're probably 
doing something wrong.<br/>
<b>Scenario 1</b>: If I see a girl and think, "She must put a lot of 
time into her appearance," it's probably because she's trying 
way too hard to pull off an outfit that just doesn't work and/or 
she caked on way too much makeup in an unskilled manner.<br/>
<b>Scenario 2</b>: I see a girl and think, "Yikes, that girl should've 
put a little more effort in this morning." She might look okay; 
she might even look pretty good, all things considered, but if 
that was my first thought when I saw her, chances are she is 
not looking her personal best.<br/>
<b>Scenario 3</b>: I see a girl and think, "Wow, she's hot." I can 
tell you one thing that I absolutely, positively have never, and 
will neVeR think as my next thought; "I'd really like to 
find out exactly how much effort this girl expends in order 
to achieve this appearance so I can compare it to the effort 
expended by comparably attractive women because that will 
be a factor in deciding whether or not I want to have anything 
to do with her." To reiterate, that has never crossed my mind.<br/>
The point is, if you look good, you look good. Guys generally don't know (even if they think they do) or care much 
about how much effort was expended to achieve the outcome, 
they just focus on the outcome. If the outcome makes a guy 
think about the preparation process, there is probably something that can be done to change the process such that it will 
improve the outcome.<br/>
And remember, a guy who says he likes girls who don't 
put too much effort into their appearance is like a five-yearold kid asking for plain tuna fish. nod and smile, but whatever you do in response to this statement, do not stop wearing 
flattering clothing, using appropriate amounts of makeup (if 
that's your thing), etc., and please, please, please, Do noT 
serve cat food to a five-year-old, no matter what he says. You

<b><h2>What should you do if you suspect 
a car has been following you?</h2>
Brandon Gregg, Does living in a surveillance van count? </b>
<p>During my counterintelligence training, I learned a few great 
tips to confirm if being followed by a vehicle, here are three 
easy ones to remember:<br/>
<font size="-1">1.</font>
Climbing Stairs - Make four right or left turns. The probability that another vehicle who just happens to make the 
same 360 turn as you is slim to none. You might both 
make one or even two turns, but anything more means 
you might have a tail. </p>
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
 on, off - While driving on the highway, take an off
ramp and then get right back on the highway. Like 
the above probability, not many people get off the 
highway and right back on. The tail is assuming you 
are exiting and exits with you but quickly is burned 
when they follow you right back on the highway. </p>
<p>Beware this doesn't always work against large teams. 
A good surveillance team knows this trick too and will 
actually exit the highway the proper way (turn around 
later). The first almost burned vehicle (Car A) drops being the lead and radios back for another vehicle (Car B) to 
continue on the highway (without exiting) to take the eye. 
A few minutes/seconds later Car A is back on the road, 
out of sight as secondary eye. </p>
<p><font size="-1">3.</font>
To fool the above, skip exiting the highway all together. 
Stay on the highway and every few miles pull over to the 
side of the road to "smoke" or "make a cell call." Both the 
lead tail (Car A) and any secondary surveillance vehicles 
(Car B, C, D) won't make a stop on the freeway; this is 
way too obvious and they will be forced to drive by you. At 
the next exit, they could be waiting for you to pass though, 
so beware.</p>
<p>As for the posted scenario, just call the police. If it's a local police surveillance, dispatch will put the call out and the 
undercover unit will cancel it and move along for now. If it's 
feds/state police, they most likely did not tell their brothers in 
blue about their surveillance and local PD will roll up on the 
vehicle. Watch them run the plates and then back off. If its a 
PI or stalker, local PD will light them up, tell them to move 
along or even let the reporting party know what is going on.</p>
<p>Big picture question &mdash; does it make sense to burn the 
surveillance team? My personal belief is yes. Think of it like 
calling their bluff and will make them back off. It really comes 
down to why you are being tracked. Surveillances, especially 
mobile surveillances, are not common or easy and only used 
for important investigations. So if you show your skills at 
counter surveillance during a basic drug surveillance, they 
will arrest you or back off. They aren't going to use resources 
over and over again just to be burned.</p>

<h3>motherhood</h3>
<h2><b>What is some advice every new 
mother should know?</b></h2>
<p><b>Alecia Li Morgan, Mother to a small posse of little boys</b>
every new mother should know a few things:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> This baby is yours </b>(and your partner's, if applicable), 
whether you adopted her, conceived him naturally, had an 
egg donor, had a sperm donor, had an everything-donor, 
etc. <b>You are this baby's.</b> Therefore, you are irreplaceable. 
Sometimes, in my moments of feeling down and subpar, 
I'll wonder if my boys would have been better off with a 
BLAnK-er, more BLAnK mother. But then I remember . . . these are mine, and I am theirs. Whatever happened to bring this baby to your arms, it happened for a 
reason, and <b>you are just right</b>.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Your life will be simpler and happier if you work hard, 
day and night, to avoid falling into the comparison trap.</b>
It took me three kids to get it, finally, but now that I have, 
I can tell you how much happier and more content I am as 
a parent. Worrying about X's baby who is crawling months 
before yours, comparing your child to Z's baby, who sleeps 
through the night, etc, all these things are unnecessary &mdash;
and sometimes, they're just part of our culture and habits. 
Fight it. Seriously. Track development and be in tune with 
your child for anything that may need extra attention and 
TLC (or even intervention), but don't compare.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Opt out of the Mommy wars.</b> Although the parenting 
community should by definition be one of mutual respect, 
love, support, and caring, many times, it can turn vicious 
and ugly. Judgements are flung from all sides. You'll feel 
like everything you do is wrong to one side or another. 
opt out. Surround yourself with friends and family who 
support you. Discuss parenting differences with an open 
mind and a loving intent. Avoid people and conversations 
who strive to compare, to criticize, and to prove They Are 
Right, other Ideas Are Wrong.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Take care of yourself. </b>Make sure you don't lose yourself to 
this new role. It's easy to let things like time for yourself, 
a shower (alone, without baby!), or a nap every now and 
then slide. But the more rundown you let yourself get, the 
tougher mothering will seem. Don't be too hard on yourself. You're learning, and so is baby.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Don't be afraid to keep learning and evolving your parenting style.</b> Just don't do it because militant this-or-thaters say you should/must. Do it because it feels right and 
natural for you, your partner, and your child. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Make the most of this time. Cherish and love your child. 
<b>Ask yourself, when you're trying to make a decision, what 
will you want to have chosen five years from now?</b> Will 
you be more glad you decided to do this, or that? What 
feels right? For example, we decided that we did not want 
to try any sort of cry-it-out method for our children. And 
four years after my first baby, I am very glad we didn't. For 
us, it was right not to.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Write letters to your child. </b>Daily, weekly, monthly, whatever. Write about how you feel about him/her right this 
moment. What things does he do that you love? What 
things do you think about while you're holding her? You 
lose these thoughts as time passes, and it's so beautiful to 
read over what you wrote, and to have that for your child. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Enjoy this. </b>Seriously, enjoy it. Although it will be hard 
work, and some days, it may seem daunting, thankless, 
and tiresome, remind yourself of the beauty of it. Take a 
time-out to just hold your baby and cuddle. In a year, you'll 
forget about the day you did no dishes or laundry and it all 
piled up, but you'll remember all the hours you snuggled 
and cuddled with your infant. In five years, those dishes 
won't matter, but those snuggles always will.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
And, beautifully, wonderfully, <b>You are not alone.</b> even if 
you live in the wilderness, hundreds of miles from other 
people, in this day and age, if you're reading this, you are 
not alone. What a wonderful gift. I have greatly appreciated, loved, and felt blessed by the amazing communities 
I've found both online and out and about as a parent. Find 
your communities, wherever they may lie, and enjoy them. 
You are not alone.</p>

<h3>parenting</h3>
<b><h2>My kids have started learning 
chess. Is it a good idea to let them 
beat me sometimes to encourage 
them?</h2>
Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder and Wikia cofounder</b>
<p>Here's what I do. Before we play, I ask my daughter if she 
wants to play "the teaching way" or straight. "The teaching 
way" means that after each of her moves, I help her analyze it 
and suggest improvements and point out any errors that I see. 
Such games tend to be very closely matched since, after all, it 
ends up being her+me against just me.</p>
<p>But she also enjoys playing straight sometimes, and then 
what's fair is fair.<br/>
I think it's absolutely a bad idea to let a kid win falsely to 
boost their confidence &mdash; it's false confidence. But I also don't 
agree with a hardcore "never let them win until they force it." 
I have found my hybrid "teaching way" to allow me to teach 
her the game more quickly.<br/>
I should point out that she's a lot smarter than I am, and 
so I'm only hastening the time of my own doom.</p>

<h3>economics</h3>
<b><h2>How would you explain to a fiveyear-old that higher taxes on the 
rich don't fix everything?</h2>
Matt Dotson, Fascinated by economics</b><br/>
So say that your five-year-old can make money by doing things 
around the house.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
$5 for making their bed<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
$5 for putting away their toys<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
$5 for putting their dirty clothes in the laundry room<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
$5 for going to bed on time<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
They can do any or all of these chores. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Dad is the government. </p>
<p>For the first $5 you earn, dad will take $1 and you keep $4. 
Dad will give this $1 to Grandpa, because Grandpa used to do 
a lot of stuff around the house (social security). So if you do 
one chore, you get $4 and pay $1 in taxes.</p>
<p>For the second $5 you earn, dad will take $2 more and 
you keep $3. Dad will use $1 to buy food for your baby sister 
(food stamps). And will give $1 to your brother who doesn't 
do any chores (welfare). If you do two chores you get $7 and 
pay $3 in taxes.</p>
<p>For the third $5 you earn, dad will take $3 more and 
you keep $2. Dad will use this money to buy a new crib for 
your baby sister (infrastructure spending). So, if you do three 
chores you get to keep $9 and pay $6 in taxes.</p>
<p>For the fourth $5 you earn, dad will take $4 more and you 
keep $1. Dad will use this money to buy some new locks for 
the doors (defense spending). So if you do 4 chores, you get to 
keep $10 and pay $10 in taxes.</p>
<p>You get to make the decision on how much money to 
make, and how to spend it. Let's say you're a rich person and 
will do 3-4 chores. Here are your options:</p>
<font size="-1">1.</font>
You can decide that all this sounds fair and do all your 
chores for $10.<br/>
<font size="-1">2.</font>
You can do some of your chores because it's not worth going to bed on time for just $1.
<p><font size="-1">3.</font>
You can vote for Mom to be the Government at the next 
family meeting because she promises that if you do 4 
chores you'll get to keep $12.</p>
<p><font size="-1">4.</font>
 You can give $1 to your aunt (who's an accountant) because she knows a special family rule about children who 
do all their chores. She says you'll get to keep $13, pay $6 
in taxes, and give her $1.</p>
<p><font size="-1">5.</font>
You can give $3 to your uncle (who's a lobbyist) because 
he can convince your Dad to not tax you for your 3rd and 
4th chores. He says you'll get to keep $14, pay $3 in taxes, 
and give him $3.</p>
<p>Raising taxes on the rich doesn't work as well as we think it 
will because rich people find ways to not pay the higher taxes.
Hopefully this example teaches about graduated tax rates 
(how we try to make rich people pay more), how rich people 
try to avoid paying taxes, and some of the ways the government spends the taxes it collects. Maybe it also teaches about 
democracy and why Government (Dad) can't make up bad 
rules or you'll vote for Mom. Maybe it also makes the fiveyear-old ask why his/her brother gets $1 for doing nothing.</p>

<h3>Bereavement and mourning</h3>
<b><h2>When should someone be finished 
grieving?</h2>
Andy Johns, I lost a parent as a child</b>
<p>My mom died when I was ten years old. now I'm a twenty-nine-year-old man. Having dealt with her loss for nearly 
twenty years, I can tell you that grief does not go away. The intensity of grief may change over time and the characteristics 
of grief you experience change as well. Yet grief rooted in the 
death of a loved one never goes away, and that is a good thing. </p>
<p>Grieving is not about making it end as quickly as possible. 
Grieving is an essential human process and it should be embraced, not ignored or expedited. As Steve Jobs said, "Death 
is very likely the single greatest invention of life." It's life's 
change-agent and you should think about grief as the environment in which change happens. For example, read about 
Dashrath Majhi. After the death of his wife, this man spent 
twenty-two years single-handedly cutting a path through a 
nearby mountain range so that other villagers could access 
local medical help more easily. From the loss of his wife, this 
man changed the lives of others. I'm sure that every time 
he picked up his tools, he felt grief, yet he was transformed 
through that process into a humanitarian.</p>
<p>My point isn't that everyone will respond in a similarly 
monumental fashion. But death changes us, and grief is the 
environment in which that change happens. With that being 
said I would encourage you to ask the question differently. 
Don't ask about how quickly you can end the grief. Instead 
you should ask, "When can I start and what might I experience along the way?"</p>
<p>If I were to describe the nature of grief I would describe 
grief with these words: <b>seasonal, imperceptible yet influential, interminable.</b></p>
<p><b>Seasonal - </b>
from what I've experienced, I can say that grief 
has a periodicity to it. The seasonality of grief during the 
Holidays is a common example. For many people, the Holidays means spending time with the people you love and that 
is true even for those that aren't physically here anymore. The 
seasonality of grief can also set in when the date of that person's death comes up or when their birthday rolls around. The 
seasonality of grief also exists in larger intervals that tend to 
be defined by major developmental periods in your life. For 
example, my grief at the loss of my mom when I was ten to 
twelve years old was very different than the grief I experience 
as a nearly thirty-year-old man.</p>
<p>As a kid, my grief happened in the absence of having an 
adult relationship with my mom and an adult understanding 
of what death and dying means. All you know is the anguish 
of loss and the separation anxiety that comes with it. As an 
adult, I experience grief in a different way. When I think 
about having a family of my own someday, I think about how I 
wish she could have been around to meet them. I think about 
what she might say to me as a grown man at times when I 
could use motherly advice. In other words, I've come to realize 
that she is still parenting me, even in death. And as I reach 
certain pivot points in my life (changing a job, buying my 
first place, having serious relationships), the grief of her loss 
makes a contribution to the decisions I make and that will 
continue to be the case as I go through each major transition 
in my life. </p>
<p><b>Imperceptible yet influential - </b>
grief will be most acute 
early on. The pain will subside as time goes and the grief itself 
may momentarily pass. Yet the loss and grief you experienced 
will continue to influence who you are and what you do imperceptibly in the future. In my case, grief influenced me in the 
form of achievement. The loss was too much for me to handle 
as a kid, so at one point my mind made the decision that it was 
going to turn off the grief switch and turn on the achievement 
switch, and I went on to spend the next nineteen years trying 
to accomplish everything I could. I did not make the mind 
shift intentionally. It just sort of happened.</p>
<p>I became a competitive athlete in every sport I played. I 
graduated high school with a 4.32 GPA. I graduated from 
UCLA in just under 3.5 years while paying my way through 
college. I started running marathons. I got bored with that. 
Then I started running ultra marathons. In recent years I had 
a full-time job but managed to start my own company based 
out of new Zealand during my free time on nights and weekends. I sold that. Then I started looking for more to do.</p>
<p>All those things are good things. I'm proud of them! But 
at some point you need to be able to sit back, relax, do less, 
and be completely content with yourself because if you don't, 
you'll burn out since that's too much pressure for anyone to 
place on themselves. It took me nearly twenty years to realize that I was doing these things because of the imperceptible influence of the ongoing grief associated with my mom's 
death. I was trying to live a meaningful life since my mom's 
life was cut short, and I wasn't going to die without making 
mine remarkable. I've felt that way since I was ten years old 
but couldn't really put it into words until now.</p>
<p><b>Interminable - </b>
pretty much everyone on this thread has 
said it, including myself, but I'll say it again. The grief will 
not go away entirely. It will become much more manageable 
with time and with effort. expect that the grief will disappear 
and reappear throughout your life. That's the natural state of 
things. People are meant to form close bonds with one another and have loving relationships. We're built for it whether 
you want to call it a divine gift or biological evolution. So 
along with love, you should expect grief. It's a part of the human condition. </p>
<p>For me, I've gone through two distinct periods of intense 
grieving at the loss of my mom. The first period took place 
when I was ten to twelve years old. The change it created 
made my life better. I grew closer with my older brothers, and 
today they are my best friends, I succeeded in school, sports, 
and having a social life and that led me to loving my time in 
high school and college. I've been very fortunate with my career at this point having worked for a handful of great companies. I've been able to travel and do some epic things like run 
a marathon in Florence, Italy and a fifty mile ultra marathon 
most recently.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I entered the second stage of grieving 
(and it wasn't easy!) but I approached it aggressively and constructively and it's already starting to produce returns. I'm 
now living in my own place and more comfortable being by 
myself than I've ever been. I'm developing a more grounded 
approach to life in that I don't feel as pressured to always be 
succeeding (it wears you down!), and I can feel that I'm emotionally maturing to a point that will set me up for meeting 
someone and starting a family of my own someday. I'm even 
evaluating what I want to do with my career and find myself 
fascinated with figuring out how over the next couple of years 
I can invest more of my work into helping others. In short, 
I'm thinking about what I want my life's work to be and helping others seems to be at the core of it. That is a very healthy 
process and the sort of change that you can expect by proactively approaching the grieving process.</p>
<p>Almost certainly, I'll enter more phases of grieving later in 
life, but I know that with each cycle things get better after a 
period of things getting worse. So I'll reiterate by saying that 
you should think of grieving differently than the way the question was asked. Don't think about how quickly you can get the 
grief over with and don't think you can avoid it either. Grief 
will surface one way or another. It is best that you approach 
grief as a healthy process and one that produces change that 
prepares you for the next phase in your life.</p>

<h3>tips and hacks for everyday life</h3>
<b><h2>How can you overcome your envy of 
people who are your age but are far 
more successful than you?</h2>
<p>Matthew Manning, Middle-Aged Soul<br/>
Emphatically stop giving a shit.</p></b>
<p><font size="-1">1.</font>
You have ZeRo idea what their personal lives are actually like, or if their outward appearance of success is total 
bullshit.</p>
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
 Stop focusing outward, focus inward. A preoccupation 
with the success of others is taking time away from tending your own internal garden.<br/>
<font size="-1">3.</font>
Believing in common measures of success (money, position, family) is believing in a ready-made lunch box of 
meaning that society is opening up and shoving down 
your throat. WHo CAReS. Figure out what success is 
for yourself and then just focus on pursuing that.</p>
<p><font size="-1">4.</font>
You are in your twenties, so be prepared to witness some 
epic personal collapses of those whom you are currently 
envious of. </p>
<p><font size="-1">5.</font>
You can't do anything besides what you can do. If you're 
giving it your all and staying focused on your values, then 
your life is progressing exactly as it should be. Did you 
hear that? eXACTLY AS IT SHoULD Be. </p>
<p><font size="-1">6.</font>
 When you have an episode of crippling self-doubt, picture each doubt as a single sheet of paper. Then crunch all

<b><h2>What book should I read to make 
girls think I'm smart in a hot way?</h2>
Cristina Hartmann, I may be addicted to books. Is there a 
program for that?</b>
<p>I suppose that I'm in the target demographic. I'm (1) a girl, 
(2) book-lover, and (3) a humanities major. I have a feeling 
that the first factor is the most critical one of them all. I'm 
afraid that my tastes aren't highbrow enough for you, but I'll 
do my very best to help you in your noble quest. </p>
<p>Before we proceed, I need to point out a contradiction. 
You say that you want to sound smart in a hot <i>and</i> a douchey 
intellectual way. I'm afraid these two things are mutually exclusive. Douchey intellectuals aren't hot or necessarily smart. 
In fact, it may be a turn-off to have someone throw around 
book titles to sound like their pants are just full of smarties. 
Just sayin'.</p>
<p>If you're determined to stay on the douchey side of the 
spectrum, it takes more than just reading fancy books. It's 
about the <i>attitude</i>. A few tips:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Tone</i> - try to keep your tone as condescending as possible. 
For example, you should disparage all obvious metaphors 
such as, "The metaphor of water in <i>The Great Gatsby </i>is 
just too utterly obvious. It's about the boat." <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Language - if</i> the book was written in a non-english language, use its original title and pronounce it correctly. For 
example, use <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i> instead of <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>. extra douche points if you read these books 
and quote passages in their original language. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Age</i> - put down newer books in favor of older, incredibly difficult to read books. This isn't a hard and fast rule 
though, thanks to David Foster Wallace. But <i>always, always</i> turn up your nose at popular fiction. <i>The Hunger 
Games</i>? Shockingly bad!</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Discussion points</i> - stories, plots, character development? 
How pedestrian. Talk about the beauty of Henry James' 
and Borges' writing. You don't even need to read them, 
just say that their prose reminds us of our fragile humanity (whatever that means).</p>
If you want to be a hot literary nerd, all you need to do is to 
tell the girl what you actually thought of the book. 
With this list, you'll be able to go either way: hot nerd or 
douchey intellectual . . . It's all about the tone.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Ulysses</i> (James Joyce): they teach entire college courses 
devoted to this book. You can't beat an eye-patched author 
for panache! </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Infinite Jest</i> (David Foster Wallace): fractals! How could 
a girl <i>not</i> swoon about a book that combines philosophy, 
mathematics and humor? </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Anything by <b>Jorge Luis Borges</b>: I'm not even sure Borges 
understood his books either. So, you can say whatever you 
want about them, it'll sound plausible. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Anything by <b>Jane Austen</b>: not only will she think you 
smart, but she'll think you a hot sensitive hunk who <i>understands women</i>. Just don't compare the girl with Fanny 
Price. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Major philosophical works of <b>Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 
John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone 
de Beauvoir</b>, and <b>Rene Descartes: </b>I'd start with <i>No Exit</i>
by Jean-Paul Sartre, at least that one is fun to read (and 
short).<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Major tragedies by <b>William Shakespeare:</b> no <i>Tempest</i> for 
you, they teach that in middle school, for goodness' sake! 
It's about the epic tragedies: <i>King Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet</i>, 
et cetera. These tragedies will allow you to be emotive, intellectual, and hot all at once. (<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is cheating though.)</p>
<p>of course, I'm just scratching the surface here, but being a 
douchey intellectual is <i>work</i>. Postscript: beware of going too 
obscure. A girl won't be impressed by something that she has 
never heard of.</p>

<h3>Jane austen</h3>
<b><h2>Which Jane Austen heroine most 
embodies feminist principles?</h2>
Stephanie Vardavas, is too generous to trifle with you</b>
<p>What a great question! It's important to remember that these 
are very young women, mostly seventeen to twenty years old, 
most of whom had no realistic choice for a life path other 
than marriage, so perhaps it's unfair to judge them too severely, but let's take a look and see what we find.</p>
<p>I should begin by saying that it is a terrible shame that 
Austen never lived to complete either <i>Sanditon </i>or <i>The Watsons</i>, because the heroines of both those fragments, <b>Charlotte 
Heywood</b> and <b>Emma Watson</b> (same name as the actress who 
played Hermione Granger), show great potential for being 
independent-minded, spunky young women who might have 
become proto-feminists. But we'll never know for sure. one 
cannot rely on completions by other writers.</p>
So remaining in our universe of potential proto-feminists 
we have:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Fanny Price<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Catherine Morland<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
emma Woodhouse<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
elinor Dashwood<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Anne elliot<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
elizabeth Bennet</p>
Let's dispose of them one at a time.
<p><b>Fanny Price</b>
 has always annoyed me a little because she's 
such a self-effacing, virtuous, goody-two-shoes little wuss. 
Compared to her reckless cousins Maria and Julia Bertram 
that's not such a bad thing, but it has never endeared her to 
me. Having said that, she does exhibit some proto-feminist 
principles: once she has used her own judgment to decide on 
what is the right thing to do, she does not allow herself to be 
swayed by anyone, for any reason. This extends to the point 
of steadfastly refusing a very advantageous marriage, because 
she does not respect &mdash; and suspects the sincerity of &mdash; her 
suitor. She's probably wrong about his sincerity, but ultimately she's right about him as a person. She falls in love with, 
and marries, her cousin edmund, who might as well love her, 
because in almost every way she is his creation. He has been 
her most caring friend and even her tutor for many years. not 
a protagonist most feminists would immediately embrace as 
one of their own.</p>
<p><b>Catherine Morland</b>
 is, frankly, just a silly girl. She is of 
fundamentally good character but she cares for little beyond 
her family, a nice muslin, and a juicy Gothic novel. She does 
have the good sense to reject the arrogant blowhard John 
Thorpe in favor of the lively metrosexual Henry Tilney, but I 
don't detect any burgeoning feminist principles in Catherine.</p>
<p><b>Emma Woodhouse</b>
 takes herself very seriously, even 
though in some ways she is just a willful teenager, and states 
openly that she fully expects to remain unmarried, obviously 
in part because she has the means and ability to live independently. In fact, <b>Emma is the only one of Austen's heroines 
who is wealthy enough in her own right to claim a serious 
level of independence</b>. Her older sister is married and she has 
no brothers. Her father dotes on her and she stands to inherit 
considerable money and property. Her friend Harriet, who 
has neither emma's economic independence nor her stiffbacked stubbornness, is a little bit scandalized, but emma 
is serious, or thinks she is. She is perfectly ready to debate 
and disagree with those around her, especially family friend 
and neighbor George Knightley. She is horrified when her 
matchmaking efforts go awry and result in a proposal to her 
instead of one to Harriet, not only because she's a terrible 
snob, but because she doesn't like it when the human chess 
pieces on her board refuse to move into the squares she has 
determined for them. She is not very good at admitting when 
she is wrong, and she's wrong a lot. But she is confident and 
strong-willed, although she ends up marrying Knightley, the 
only man in her life who ever scolds her. So I'm not prepared 
to induct her into the proto-feminist hall of fame just yet.</p>
<p><b>Elinor Dashwood </b>
is a different kind of creature. She is 
not much older than Catherine, but silly is the last word I'd 
use to describe her. She is very serious about money and the 
other realities of life, and becomes essentially the business 
manager for her mother and sisters when her half-brother 
and his loathsome wife turn them out of their estate after 
the death of her father. It is elinor who keeps track of how 
much they can afford, reminds her sister Marianne and their 
mother to be practical, and who relentlessly represses her 
own attachment to edward Ferrars because she fears she is 
doomed to disappointment. Finally edward calls on the Dashwoods and, awkwardly, they learn that he not in fact married 
to another, but free.</p>
<p><font size="-1">elinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, 
and as soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which 
at first she thought would never cease. edward, who had till 
then looked any where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, 
and perhaps saw&ndash;or even heard, her emotion; for immediately 
afterwards he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, 
no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and 
at last, without saying a word, quitted the room, and walked out 
towards the village &ndash; leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so wonderful 
and so sudden;  a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures.</font></p>
<p>I would say that 
<b>Elinor does exhibit some sound feminist 
principles. She is realistic about money, not obsessed with 
romance, and determined to protect her family's independence.</b></p>
<p>Poor 
<b>Anne Elliot</b>. Anne is a sensible woman of about 
twenty-seven who, as a young woman of nineteen, was overly 
influenced (to break off her engagement to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, because he was not her social 
equal) by those around her. And what a group they are! She 
has a silly, vain, snobbish father who happens to be a baronet; 
a silly, vain, snobbish sister, elizabeth; and a silly, hypochondriacal, self-centered sister, Mary. Her snobbish godmother, 
Lady Russell, is the only person in her life who truly loves 
her, and yet even Lady Russell is such a snob that following 
her advice caused Anne to deprive herself of the deepest happiness by following it. But Anne has had eight long years to 
reflect on her regret, and while she is too insecure and ladylike to <i>pursue</i> the man she still loves when he returns to her 
orbit, she has learned a valuable lesson or two about being 
her own woman. We find Anne engaging in intellectual discussions about books and poetry with male acquaintances in 
Wentworth's circles, and on one notable occasion debating 
politely but with some disagreement &mdash; in Wentworth's hearing &mdash; about the relative capacities of men and women for 
total devotion in extreme circumstances.</p>
<font size="-1"><p>"oh!" cried Anne eagerly, "I hope I do justice to all that is felt by 
you, and by those who resemble you. God forbid that I should 
undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose 
that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">no, 
<b>I believe you capable of everything great and good in your 
married lives. I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as  if I may 
be allowed the expression  so long as you have an object. I 
mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you. All the 
privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; 
you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence 
or when hope is gone."</b> She could not immediately have uttered 
another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much 
oppressed.</font></p></font>
<p><b>Anne also exhibits some sound feminist principles by the end 
of the novel. She is determined to trust only her own best 
judgment in deciding whom to trust and what will make her 
happy, and she does</b>. She marries Wentworth, who has become wealthy in the navy by way of prize money for capturing 
French ships, and he buys her an estate by the sea.</p>
<p>Saving the best (or at least the best beloved) for last, we 
move on to <b>Elizabeth Bennet</b>. everyone adores elizabeth 
Bennet, and even her creator considered her "as delightful 
a creature as ever appeared in print." She's the second of five 
daughters of a minor landowner whose estate, Longbourn, is 
entailed away from the female line.</p>
<p>Austen was never much for physical descriptions, but she 
tells us that elizabeth is highly intelligent, witty, clever, has 
a pretty face with beautiful dark eyes, and a pleasing figure. 
She is well read, plays the piano and sings, and is a loyal and 
caring friend and sister. She is especially devoted to her older 
sister Jane. She knows that because of the entail, she cannot 
have an independent future: either she will marry, or live as 
an old maid in the home of her sister. She is determined to 
marry, if at all, only for love. In the service of this ideal, she 
turns down the first two marriage proposals that come her 
way, one from William Collins, the inane male cousin who 
stands to inherit Longbourn upon the death of Mr. Bennet, 
and the other from Fitzwilliam Darcy, possibly the richest 
man in Derbyshire and certainly one of the most eligible bachelors in england, in both cases because she does not like or 
respect them. After she learns that she has been badly prejudiced and misinformed about Darcy's character and personal 
qualities, she searches her soul and judges herself harshly. She 
and Darcy are thrown together one more time, and this time 
they find their way to a happy ending.</p>
<p>elizabeth truly is an interesting character. She's a romantic. Her fierce determination to marry only for love collides 
with her equally fierce loyalty to her family in the moment 
when Collins proposes to her. She could, by accepting him, 
ensure that her family is never turned out of Longbourn. But 
she never hesitates. She does not love him, or even particularly like him, and she has too much self-respect to accept him 
(as her friend Charlotte does, less than twenty four hours later). She holds firm to her principles and eventually she figures 
out that she has misjudged Darcy, and that in fact she loves 
him. She then marries for love, having providentially chosen 
a man so wealthy that her family will always be provided for. </p>
<p>even though elizabeth is caught up in societal strictures 
that basically force her to make her way in the world by marrying, she does it on her own terms. Although she marries a 
very rich man, she cannot be accused of avarice, or even excessive practicality, because if she were marrying for money, 
she would have accepted Darcy the first time. </p>
<b><p>While Anne Elliot and Elinor Dashwood, each in their 
own way, exhibit some strong feminist principles, Elizabeth 
Bennet exhibits the most modern feminist sensibility of all 
Austen's heroines.</p>

<h3>Jane austen</h3>
<b><h2>What is so great about Jane 
Austen?</h2>
Shan Kothari, not nearly as well-read as I'd like to think.</b>
I'm going to focus on just one aspect in which Austen has 
been pioneering in the art of writing: narration.
<p>There's a narrative technique called free indirect discourse 
(FID) which blends third-person narration with a direct, firstperson view into a character's mind. Wikipedia gives as an 
example this sentence: "He laid down his bundle and thought 
of his misfortune. And just what pleasure had he found, since 
he came into this world?" even though the second sentence is 
clearly coming from the "He" identified in the first sentence, 
rather than the booming voice of God, the second sentence 
lacks any of the marks of quoted or reported speech, like "he 
said" or "he thought." Used properly, this can make the transition into the character's mind more fluid and less intrusive.</p>
<p>Here's an example from 
<i>Persuasion</i>: "How Anne&rsquo;s more 
rigid requisitions might have been taken, is of little consequence. Lady Russell&rsquo;s had no success at all&ndash;could not be put 
up with&ndash;were not to be borne." (FID is useful in <i>Persuasion</i>
because of how much thinking Anne does; it is much of what 
makes Anne feel like a real person, despite the fact that she 
doesn't do much at all.)</p>
<p>Austen is widely recognized as one of the first writers to 
ever use FID. (Sometimes Goethe is also cited, but I wouldn't 
know about him.) Citing critics like Dorrit Cohn and David 
Lodge, David Gunn writes that "Jane Austen is generally acknowledged to be the first english novelist to make sustained 
use of free indirect discourse in the representation of figural 
speech and thought."</p>
<p>But other people have used free indirect discourse, right? 
So what does it matter that she was the first?<br/>
I like the way Gunn dissects this passage from emma:</p>
<p><font size="-1">Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero 
of this inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; 
but emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick 
eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a 
push&mdash;of having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to 
see how it might turn up. His ostensible reason, however, was 
to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the 
evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest 
degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must 
give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much 
about his dining with him&mdash;had made such a point of it, that he 
had promised him conditionally to come.</font></p>
<p>Here we have an external report transitioning into the mockery of "the hero of this inimitable charade" (Mr. elton), then 
more external reports until "having thrown a die" &mdash; which in 
its use of a particular phrase, puts us into the mind of emma. 
More FID begins with "His ostensible reason," and by the end 
of that sentence, with "whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary," Austen is imitating Mr. elton's speech 
patterns, putting the reader into Mr. elton's mind in such a 
way that the reader may not be aware of the transition at all. 
The next sentence is all Mr. elton's thoughts, but note that it 
never once says "Mr. elton thought." It doesn't need to; that 
would be overkill.</p>
<p>now, this narrative style looks pretty standard in today's 
literature. But in Austen's time, <i>nobody</i> was doing this. Fifty 
years earlier, Laurence Sterne was messing around with unreliable narrators in <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, but until Austen started 
writing, it was difficult to maintain the power of seeing into 
a character's thoughts while keeping narratorial authority. 
(Sterne was clearly not interested in narratorial authority.) 
Most narrators were still stupid blockheads like the titular 
Pamela of Samuel Richardson's famous epistolary novel. Austen's narration allows us to get into her character's heads in a 
way that is all the more powerful precisely because it doesn't 
feel forced.</p>
<p>So really, it's the way she uses FID and other techniques 
with such sheer <i>attitude</i> that makes it impressive. The fluid 
shifts of perspective it allows is part of what gives her books 
such satirical force. And it still holds up against the best narration in today's novels.</p>

<h3>harry potter</h3>
<b><h2>Toward the end of <i>Harry Potter: 
Order of the Phoenix</i>, why don't the 
kids just gang up on and overpower 
Umbridge?</h2>
Danielle Maurer, Slytherin Prefect</b>
<p>There are a number of reasons why this is so. Let's start with:
<b>1. Umbridge is not just one woman.</b> As the question states, <br/>
she has Filch and her squad of Slytherin enforcers. And while <br/>
normally the students would not be afraid to be defiant of <br/>
Filch and some Slytherins, Umbridge has given new meaning <br/>
to the word "punishment." The Slytherins are entitled to use <br/>
magic against other students (I think) and can take House <br/>
points away, in addition to assigning detention. And on the 
subject of detention, I think we've seen just how sadistic Umbridge can be with that. Filch has been given permission to 
use the chains and manacles he's always been so fond of, and 
surely no students wants to suffer through that. And then, 
this is bigger than just Umbridge, leading to my next point, <br/>
that . . .<br/>
<b>2. Umbridge is from the Ministry of Magic. </b>And that <br/>
means a hell of a lot. Should a full-blown student revolution <br/>
start, Umbridge can call in all kinds of hell, in the form of the <br/>
Magical Law enforcement Squad, Aurors, and maybe even <br/>
dementors (again). I'm sure nobody wants to open that can of <br/>
worms. even if the students decided to go against the Ministry, what would happen if they lost? There's a good chance <br/>
they'd be tried in court, a farce that they would surely lose, <br/>
and their wands would be snapped. They might even get sent <br/>
to Azkaban. That would be the end of it. And with that as a <br/>
potential consequence, it puts a damper on any defiance that <br/>
the students might want to try. There are special cases too, <br/>
like with the Weasleys. Umbridge's influence could get their <br/>
father fired in retaliation. As someone has already said, even <br/>
Dumbledore did not try to push her aside; he was aware of <br/>
these ties as much as anybody, and unseating her would have <br/>
to go through the system. Additionally, we are fairly certain <br/>
that . . .<br/>
<b>3. Umbridge is not working for Voldemort. </b>As Sirius says <br/>
in order of the Phoenix, the world is not divided into good <br/>
people and Death eaters. Umbridge may be evil, but she's not <br/>
the real enemy here. There's a difference between her oppression of students at Hogwarts and the oppression of the Carrows in Deathly Hallows. In Deathly Hallows, the students <br/>
strike back where they can, to the point of neville being on <br/>
the run inside the school, and they aren't afraid to do so. <i>But <br/>
the stakes are higher against the Carrows because they work <br/>
for Voldemort</i>. Umbridge doesn't. The drive to rebel against <br/>
her is much less, despite what she's done in terms of rules and <br/>
driving out Dumbledore. <br/>
<b>4. Umbridge has the population of Hogwarts sufficiently downtrodden already. </b>She was slow and insidious and it <br/>
worked to her advantage. no student was going to rebel while <br/>
Dumbledore was still Headmaster, and by the time he fled, 
Umbridge had already managed to squash the spirit out of 
the student body. She created the right kind of atmosphere 
where it sapped the energy and strength of the student body. 
Introducing things like student informers helped with that 
&mdash; because if you can't confide in your fellows students, how 
can you start a rebellion? It's hopeless, right? So why not just 
give up? Harry and his friends are a small core of students 
that trust each other implicitly; that's how they are able to 
resist, by feeding off each other's attitudes and skills. But the 
majority of the student body doesn't have that. And look what 
happens to Dumbledore's Army because of misplaced trust. <br/>
And  lastly . . .<br/>
<b>5. There is an implied level of skill difference. </b>Harry and <br/>
Co. are all, for the most part, great at various disruptive spells <br/>
and jinxes, hexes and curses. And they're practicing because <br/>
they know they're going to be fighting Voldemort in the end. <br/>
But the rest of the school &mdash; well, most of them believe the <br/>
Ministry. Voldemort isn't back, so who cares? They're probably still focused on learning other things, which may or may <br/>
not make them useless in a fight. And even if the whole student body rose up, how many of them would be good against <br/>
what Umbridge could call in? How many could produce a Patronus against dozens of dementors? or successfully duel any <br/>
adult wizard from the Department of Magical Law enforcement? I'd say 1st-3rd years are out, and maybe fourth years <br/>
too. That severely cuts down the amount of potentially useful <br/>
fighters you've got. </p>

<h3>the hunger games</h3>
<b><h2>Is<i> The Hunger Games</i> a pro-girl / 
pro-woman story, the way <i>Brave</i> is?</h2>
Tyler Borchers, journalist</b>
<p>I haven't read 
<i>The Hunger Games</i>, but my best friend and 
english major Spencer Smith has. Spencer was more than 
happy to collaborate with me to answer this question. Here&rsquo;s 
what he had to say about <i>The Hunger Games</i>:</p>
<font size="-1"><p>First of all, my answer will be limited because I have only read 
the first book in Suzanne Collins&rsquo;s series. Katniss is one of the 
strongest female characters I have read in young adult literature. However, that isn&rsquo;t saying much in a genre that is often 
criticized for placing weak female characters in tired plot structures involving romance, romance, and perhaps more romance.</p>
<b>Evidence that <i>The Hunger Games</i> is pro-girl</b>
<font color="#FF0000"><p>Katniss is independent, almost to a fault. She's often criticized 
by other characters for not asking for help. Haymitch, for 
instance, finds Katniss almost uncoachable. When he is instructing her prior to the nationally broadcasted interview, he says, &ldquo;I 
give up, sweetheart. Just answer the questions and try not to let 
the audience see how openly you despise them&rdquo; (118). But this 
independence is precisely the key to Katniss&rsquo;s success. It leads 
her to each triumph and heroic moment &mdash; providing food for 
her family, going as tribute in place of her sister, impressing 
the Gamemakers, destroying the Career Tributes&rsquo; provisions, 
providing a ceremony to commemorate Rue&rsquo;s death, going back 
to the Cornucopia to get medicine for Peeta, and ultimately 
deciding to defy the Capitol in the end. In other words, almost 
every single plot point is brought about by an independent 
choice made by Katniss.</p>
<p>The other characters are extremely aware of Katniss&rsquo;s ferocious independence. When Gale is introduced in the very beginning, Katniss tells us explicitly that &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been anything romantic between Gale and me&rdquo; (10). While it&rsquo;s possible 
that Katniss is not totally reliable here; it&rsquo;s clear that Gale and 
Katniss are equal partners and not stereotypical lovers. There&rsquo;s a 
scene in the first chapter where Katniss and Gale discuss &ldquo;their 
kids&rdquo; when talking about their siblings. The juxtaposition of 
the nuclear family with their predicament here is strong. In the 
Katniss-Gale nuclear family, ravished by poverty, both mother 
and father are providers. Gale is acutely aware of Katniss&rsquo;s abilities, telling her, &ldquo;We could [run away and live in the woods], 
you know&rdquo; (9). The implication is that Katniss, unlike other 
women from District 12, is able to fend for herself and has the </p></font>
requisite skills to survive.
<p>Gale is not the only male character to recognize Katniss&rsquo;s 
strength. Peeta does as well. In fact, Peeta is so sure of Katniss 
that he ties his fate to hers in the broadcasted interview by professing his love for her. This scene, of course, is an inversion of 
the typical chivalrous relationship, in which the man professes 
his love in order to <i>save</i>. In this case, the man professes his love 
in order to <i>be saved</i>. This gives Katniss power in their relationship. And Peeta is exactly right. His declaration results in his 
life being saved multiple times.</p>
<b>Evidence that <i>The Hunger Games</i> is ambivalent about feminism</b>
<p>The romantic relationship between Katniss and Peeta is ambiguous. In one reading of the novel, the relationship (at least 
on Katniss&rsquo;s end) is completely constructed for victory in the 
Hunger Games. In another reading, the romantic relationship 
happens naturally and coincidentally benefits Katniss and Peeta. 
This ambiguity is supported by the end of the novel. Peeta accuses Katniss of faking everything for the Games. She responds 
that not all of her actions were faked, implying that much of 
them were. The last sentence of the book, though, reads, &ldquo;I take 
[Peeta&rsquo;s] hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, 
and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go&rdquo; 
(374). I&rsquo;m not sure what we are supposed to make of this. If 
the Peeta-Katniss relationship is completely artificial, then it 
strengthens the novel&rsquo;s feminist tilt. Katniss is always in control. 
She recognizes the banality of traditional gender roles and feels 
free to manipulate them in order to subversively achieve desired 
outcomes.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think this is what most of the novel&rsquo;s 
audience takes from the book. I taught <i>The Hunger Games</i>
to a group of ninth graders this summer. If I hadn&rsquo;t read the 
book myself and my only knowledge of the book came from my 
students' summaries, I would have thought Peeta and Katniss's 
romance was a centerpiece of the plot. even when encouraged 
to consider the authenticity of the relationship, most of my 
students characterized Katniss&rsquo;s confusion as a case of her lying 
to herself rather than actually conflicting emotions.</font></p>
<b>Evidence that </b><i>The Hunger Games</i><b> is not pro-girl</b>
<p>If
<i> The Hunger Games</i> was to be judged only on Katniss, I think 
it would be easy to characterize it as pro-girl. However, <i>The 
Hunger Games</i> exists in a post-apocalyptic universe in which 
other female characters exist. Basically all of these characters 
fall into gendered stereotypes. Katniss&rsquo;s mother, for instance, 
has a mental breakdown when her husband dies. effie is overly 
cheery, materialistic and is constantly concerned about Katniss&rsquo;s 
lack of lady-like qualities. Rue seems to only be female as a contrast to Katniss&rsquo;s younger sister. Foxface, while being extremely 
important to the plot (she finishes fourth in the Games, losing 
to Katniss, Peeta, and Cato), never receives a real name. Thus, 
the only other strong female character in the book is accused of 
being manipulative and sly like a fox and is given a corresponding nickname.</p></font>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s draw a distinction between settings. 
<i>The Hunger 
Games</i>&rsquo; dystopia is penned in heavy ink, yet gender issues must 
compete on each page with myriad other social critiques. It is 
more pessimistic, but also broader in its pessimism.</p>
<p>The world of 
<i>Brave</i> is foremost a patriarchy. This is clear 
from the beginning. Merida&rsquo;s incompatibility with the patriarchy, too, is more a premise than a plot. <i>Brave</i>&rsquo;s critique is 
often understated. If you don&rsquo;t recognize patriarchies in the 
real world, you might not in <i>Brave</i> either. Just skim a few 
movie reviews and you&rsquo;ll find many critics thought <i>Brave</i> was 
too safe a story for Pixar and featured a conflict driven principally by teenage angst. As is often the case with criticism, 
<i>Brave</i> is told using a language in which we&rsquo;re all variably fluent. That is certainly a weakness, but I would argue it&rsquo;s also 
a strength. A muted message is more true to the experiences 
of women living under patriarchy, who are often told that the 
oppression they encounter is imagined. Dramatizing those experiences into a dystopia that everyone can see misrepresents 
the many women living in covert dystopias across the globe.</p>
<p>Their plots can be distinguished using similar logic. In 
both stories, the protagonists are the only female characters 
who challenge gender norms in any serious way. In <i>Brave</i>, this 
is necessary. It is a story about a young girl defying patriarchy. 
The patriarchy is a character. It needs to exist onscreen. And 
remember, that doesn&rsquo;t just mean men ruling over women &mdash; 
it refers to an ideology that any person can promote, regardless of gender. When Merida&rsquo;s mother enforces the gender 
code and her father seems indifferent or even unaware of it, 
<i>Brave</i> accurately reflects a situation commonly described by 
feminists. Because <i>The Hunger Games</i> isn't about patriarchy, it doesn&rsquo;t demand female stereotypes in the same way. 
Frankly, I&rsquo;m not convinced that Katniss&rsquo; femaleness is even 
required. With a few tweaks to her character, I think <i>The 
Hunger Games</i> could be essentially salvaged. Turn Merida 
into a boy and her story unravels.</p>
<p>Katniss&rsquo; deviance from the gender norm was initially 
learned, then necessary for her survival. Her deviant behavior 
persists due to personal preference, but Merida is concerned 
with her own autonomy from beginning to end. According 
to her, she should be able to do what she wants as an end 
in itself, not as a means to survival or because someone else 
instilled her with the skills and passion necessary. Where <i>The 
Hunger Games</i> gives reasons for Katniss&rsquo; deviance, <i>Brave</i>
boldly declines to <i>explain</i> why Merida is different. She just is.</p>
<p>Regardless of how genuine Katniss&rsquo; relationship with 
Peeta is, it&rsquo;s constructed to fit neatly into a gendered box. 
<i>Brave</i> alludes to these boxes as reference points from which 
its audience might understand Merida. But they offer no protection from being discredited by men. Katniss is stigmatized 
for refusing her gender role, while Merida is deemed an unreliable source of information. Both of these phenomena are 
well-documented in feminist literature and by Hollywood. 
When this conflict appears on the big screen, it&rsquo;s normally resolved by having the woman retain her flair of independence 
while ultimately conforming to the master narrative: falling 
in love with and marrying a man. <i>Brave</i> lives up to its name 
by setting up a convenient compromise, then doubling down 
anyway. Merida could <i>defy</i> by convincing the clans that she 
should get to choose who she marries and then <i>conform</i> by 
choosing. Instead, she is totally defiant, claiming her right to 
not choose.</p>
<p>I'll follow Merida's example and claim that right too. 
neither Spencer nor I can say <i>The Hunger Games</i> is a progirl story the way <i>Brave</i> is. each story contains pro-girl sentiment, and each story expresses that sentiment in different 
ways. Hopefully the ideas we've shared here can help you answer that question for yourself.</p>

<h3>the hunger games</h3>
<b><h2>Does race or ethnicity play a role 
in <i>The Hunger Games</i> series? If so, 
how?</h2>
Monika Kothari, abecedarian</b>
<p><b>Whether or not Panem is a post-racial society, the United 
States in the present &mdash; that is, the time, place, and audience 
for which Suzanne Collins is writing &mdash; is not.</b> It's possible to 
write a book in which race is not a major theme, of course, or 
for individual readers to dismiss race as an important factor, 
but we live in a society that's <i>obsessed</i> with race. <i>Our</i> world is 
not post-racial, and in critical analysis, race can't be treated 
as irrelevant . . . especially in a bestselling YA series &mdash; even 
a futuristic science fiction one. So while race doesn't have 
to be central to every aspect of our culture, and it's probably 
healthier if we don't obsess over it as we do, it will remain an 
important issue for as long as racism remains a real problem.</p>
<p>When writing characters, it's almost impossible 
<i>not</i> to 
take race into consideration. even if race is not significant 
in Panem, Collins made conscious decisions to make some 
characters white (e.g. Peeta), some characters black (e.g. 
Rue), and some characters ambiguous (e.g. Katniss). <b>These 
racial distinctions can't have been arbitrary choices; no race 
is "neutral" even if we've been acculturated to believe that 
white is the norm.</b> Why should we assume that a character is 
white unless explicitly described otherwise? Unless Rue and 
Thresh are just token minorities designed to satisfy the terms 
of political correctness in our society, which is a whole other 
issue in itself, there must be some logic behind their depiction 
as black.</p>
<p>(
<i>Aside</i>: White and black aren't the only races, but no characters in particular are identified as Asian, native American, etc. But it's also important to remember that<b> in a postapocalyptic world where "Asia," the "United States," "Latin 
America," the "Middle East," and other regions don't exist 
in the same way, race can't be discussed in the same terms</b>. 
It wouldn't make sense for Katniss to refer to Rue as "African 
American" &mdash; as Collins does in an interview &mdash; if "Africa" and 
"America" don't mean anything. However, Rue is explicitly described as having dark skin, and Collins does confirm that she 
and Thresh, and most of District 11, are black. of course, that 
didn't prevent a storm of fanger over the casting of a black 
actor as Rue, who apparently should be "blond" and "white" 
to "look like Prim." It seems like some so-called "fans" believe 
that people of color shouldn't even have minor roles to disrupt 
the pure whiteness of their imagined Panem &mdash; so never mind 
the storm of hatred that would've resulted if Katniss had been 
cast as anything other than white.)</p>
<p><b>Katniss' ambiguous coloring is intentional.</b>
 Her mother 
and sister are clearly fair-skinned and blonde-haired, while 
Katniss is "olive"-skinned and black-haired. She's specifically 
described in contrast to her mother and sister, and resembles 
her miner father rather than the fair merchant class that her 
mother represents. Her skin tone can't be environmentally determined &mdash; she's never worked in the mines, and her mother 
and sister, who live in the same environment, don't share her 
coloring or hair. We can assume that it's inherited, and because her father, Gale, and Haymitch are described with similar terms, we can also assume that this darker skin and hair is 
prevalent throughout the Seam.</p>
<p>In contrast, the town is mostly fair and blonde, like Peeta, 
Madge, Prim, and Katniss's mother. This is quite a sharp distinction in appearance &mdash; even if it doesn't amount to "racial" 
difference, <b>there's some kind of class-color divide here</b>. It may 
not be an explicit statement on race, if you as a reader don't 
want it to be, and it's a distinction that's probably been exacerbated by social separation, but its a noted difference nonetheless. Likewise, District 11, one of the poorest Districts if 
not <i>the</i> poorest, is mostly black, while the entire ruling elite 
in the Capitol, and all of the tributes from the Career Districts appear to be white. Personally, I think there is a deeper 
level to having District 11 as a primarily black District, as the 
presence of Rue, Thresh, Seeder, Chaff, and their families indicate. District 11 is:</p>
<p><font size="-1">1.</font>
A large, agricultural District (orchards, grains, cotton);<br/>
<font size="-1">2.</font>
Probably in the Deep South;<br/>
<font size="-1">3.</font>
Where residents do backbreaking work night and day;<br/>
<font size="-1">4.</font>
Where residents sing as they work;<br/>
<font size="-1">5.</font>
Where poverty and hunger are prevalent;<br/>
<font size="-1">6.</font>
Heavily patrolled by Peacekeepers;</p>
<font size="-1">7.</font>
one of the most unhappy and rebellious, even among the 
poor Districts.
<p>Does this sound familiar to anyone? Plantation life, slavery, 
and the antebellum South, perhaps? or post-Reconstruction 
sharecropping? I don't think this is a coincidence. <b>District 
11 has clear and intentional parallels to the historical treatment of black people in the United States</b>, which only further 
serves to highlight the dystopic reality of Panem. Does race 
matter in Panem? Maybe not, but I think that this parallel 
is an important comment on institutional racism of the past 
and present in <i>our</i> United States. A reader could easily miss 
or dismiss the reference, but I think it's there for a reason.</p>
<p>(
<i>Aside</i>: Likewise, District 12 reflects the history of mining 
conditions, poverty, and labor relations in Appalachia, which 
have also been, and continue to be, appalling at times. I think 
it's pretty cool that Katniss, as an Appalachian character, will 
be portrayed by an actor from that general region of the country &mdash; Jennifer Lawrence is from Louisville, Kentucky.)</p>
<p>Moving beyond District 11, the Capitol rules over all of 
Panem from a distance, with enforcers ("Peacekeepers") in 
every region. Due to geography and industry, some Districts 
are more closely watched than others. The Capitol citizens 
live in luxury from the industries of the Districts, with cosmetic surgery, bingeing and purging, etc. This whole setup 
has, from my point of view, <b>colonial undertones that parallel 
historical imperialism</b>, which usually had racial implications 
of white europeans occupying and claiming the resources of 
non-white peoples. Again, this doesn't explicitly bring race 
into the equation, and indeed you can ignore the race/ethnicity all together without losing an appreciation for the series, 
but it's yet another aspect to think about among the other 
themes.</p>
<p>So all this time, I've been arguing that whether or not 
race matters in Panem is less important than whether race 
matters to the <i>audience</i> when determining whether or not it 
plays a role in the series. A clear example of this is <b>the casting 
of Lenny Kravitz as Cinna</b>, the firestorm that resulted. All I 
remember from the book was that Cinna was described as 
having short, dark hair and looking "normal" relative to the 
rest of the Capitol citizens. How does this description reveal 
anything about race? <b>Does he have to be explicitly described 
as black to be black &mdash; is "white" the only "normal"? </b>I think 
that the casting controversy here reveals that even if race 
isn't important in Panem, <i>The Hunger Games</i> still forces us 
to think about and confront race in our own society. It's one 
thing to be upset the Kravitz isn't your ideal "physical type" for 
Cinna, and it's another to be flipping out over his race. Check 
out some of the bizarre comments about it:</p>
<i><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Isn't Cinna flamboyant? Not black.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
i imagined him as a gay white guy with brown and is skinny</i> . . .<i> he better act gay!<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Ew, since when was he black?</i>
<p>Source: http://www.racialicious.com/2011/11/15/yes-there-areblack-people-in-your-hunger-games-the-strange-case-of-ruecinna/</p>
<p>Admittedly, I picked some of the worst comments of the 
lot, but you get the point. Furthermore, the fanbase has scrutinized Kravitz's acting abilities much more than any of the 
other characters' actors, even though his is only a supporting role next to the white leads, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh 
Hutcherson. (Plus, whether or not Kravitz's body type looks 
the part, he just exudes c<i>ool</i>, I mean really . . . ) By the way, 
this would make Cinna the only major supporting character 
of unambiguous color in the series (if you accept the films 
as canon), as Rue, Thresh, Seeder, and Chaff all appear in 
only one book, and all are from the "farming" District. (Yes, 
I know it's the Hunger Games and that lots of people have 
to die . . . but the fact that no characters that are described 
as brown-skinned actually survive the series is something to 
think about.)</p>
<p>Finally, I think that blogger Alexiel makes a lot of controversial but interesting points about the premise of the series 
as a metaphor about people of color:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Looking at the world today, most oppressive dictatorships 
exist in countries with non-white peoples. Furthermore 
many of these people have, in recent years, begun to organize and rebel against their regimes. Suzanne Collins was 
inspired to write the series after watching footage of the 
invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
either as a localized revolution against a dictator in the 
Global South, or as a global analogy related to the wealth 
and power of the north, the Hunger Games is one large 
metaphor for people of color rising up against oppression. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Katniss everdeen &ndash; coming out of impoverished, desperate conditions to unwittingly end up in a revolution 
to overthrow the regime that keeps her people down &ndash; 
could be any one of the many people of color coming out 
of analogous situations who frequently lack the power to 
overthrow an entire government or economic world order. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Collins is telling us: people will rebel against oppression; 
brown-skinned people do want political power; it is wrong 
for rich, excessive cultures to benefit from the desperate, 
oppressive conditions of &ldquo;others&rdquo;.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
If this metaphor doesn&rsquo;t exist, and I completely made it 
up, then I&rsquo;ll admit it: I have no idea what the Hunger 
Games could possibly be about besides sensationalism and 
reality TV with some glorified child-soldiering thrown in. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 In other words, if Katniss is white, the metaphor that 
makes the trilogy meaningful social commentary and inspirational to the would-be revolutionaries of color in the 
world is lost. It&rsquo;s just an appropriation of struggles. It is 
a re-writing of history that erases us, erases our struggles 
and our victories.</p>
Source: http://xalexiel.blogspot.com/2011/03/why-katniss-eve
rdeen-is-woman-of-color.html
<p>I'm not saying that Alexiel is more correct in her interpretation than any of us (and it is a <i>total and complete</i> interpretation, unlike anything I've seen discussed &mdash; and worth 
reading). But her perspective is compelling, at least to me, 
and it goes to show how subjective the reader's experience is. 
To a white reader, or even a non-white reader, this series may 
not be about race &mdash; race may not even occur to him/her as an 
issue to think about. But to this particular Guyanese blogger, 
it absolutely is! Her position is extreme, and one I don't share, 
but I don't think that her analysis is entirely wrong. <b>There's 
definitely a place for interpreting a racial or ethnic meaning 
into the series. If you don't see it at all, that's fine, but you 
could be missing out on some interesting perspectives.</b></p>
<p><b>We live in a world where race matters.</b>
 Whether you have 
a cast of characters that's all white, all black, all Asian, etc. 
or a mixture . . . Whether you employ racial archetypes or stereotypes or avoid/subvert them . . . Whether you describe the 
characters' races explicitly or ambiguously . . . There's almost 
always some comment to be made about what this means for 
our social reality. Whenever <i>The Hunger Games</i> takes place 
&mdash; and it could be hundreds of years in the future where race 
is irrelevant &mdash; <b>it's a very contemporary work of fiction with 
contemporary implications</b>.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>
<h3>Jay-Z</h3>
<b><h2>What is so great about Jay-Z?</h2>
Aaron Ellis, Former Music Critic with Artist Farm</b>
<p>one of the singles from Jay-Z's now classic debut album, 
<i>Reasonable Doubt</i>, was a song called "Can't Knock The Hustle." 
While there are many interpretations about the exact meaning of the song, I have always felt that the phrase "can't knock 
the hustle" means that there is no substitute for hard work; 
that hard work always yields respect and success. To me, this 
is why Jay-Z is great. He is a hustler in the truest sense of the 
word, and his hardcore work ethic has brought him success in 
every arena in which he has applied himself. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Early Business Acumen</b> - A real hustler is someone who 
can discover alternative ways of doing things. When Jay-Z 
was an unsigned rapper, he sold his tapes from the trunk 
of his car while trying to get a record deal. All of the major 
labels refused to sign him. He finally scored a deal with 
Payday Records, but after seeing how amateur their operations were, he realized something that became very critical to his success: <b>they didn't do anything for him that he 
couldn't do for himself</b>. All the promotion and marketing 
they did for him were things that he could do on his own 
and probably better. So Jay struck out on his own and used 
his own money towards forming Roc-A-Fella Records 
with Dame Dash and Biggs Burke. Jay-Z initially set out 
to become a rapper. But seeking a new way to put out his 
product, he ended up becoming an entrepreneur. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Rapping Ability </b>- Jay-Z is the most talented rapper alive. 
Back in the 1990s, he became known as "The Master of 
All Flows," a title only bestowed upon an extremely exclusive group of elite rappers. While most rappers only have 
one flow style, Jay-Z has mastered every flow in existence. 
Fast. Slow. Syncopated. Straightforward. Poetic. narrative. He can do it all. He is a rapper's rapper, which is to 
say, he's a guy who other rappers (such as Kanye West) 
idolize. This is not just natural ability. This is the sign of 
someone who is a tireless perfectionist when it comes to 
his craft. Beyond his flow, Jay is just a great lyricist. He is 
a great storyteller and can flip clever metaphors and puns 
better than anyone. He can make comfortable party music 
like "Big Pimpin" or serious message music like "Minority 
Report," a powerful song about Hurricane Katrina. on 
record, Jay can do anything. For further proof, watch his 
episode of <i>Storytellers</i>, where he performs in front of an 
audience and shares the full meaning behind the lyrics of 
the key songs from his excellent <i>American Gangster</i> album. The amount of thought that went into every bar is 
astounding. It will make you re-examine everything about 
that album and all others he has made.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Studio Hustle</b> - Jay-Z has a reputation for having an extreme work ethic. He doesn't write down his lyrics; he has 
everything memorized in his head. Seriously. Unlike other 
rappers, who use notebooks, notepads, or even Blackberries to pen a song, Jay-Z has every bar and every verse of 
his songs etched in his brain. When he enters the studio 
to record a track, he is always over-prepared. Because his 
lyrics are already memorized, he needs very few takes to 
record an entire track. Anyone who wants to collaborate 
with Jay-Z must be prepared for the fact that he moves 
at a very fast pace with incredible attention to detail. The 
added bonus of the studio hustle is that it he cuts costs on 
production. Rather than wasting money on studio fees for 
doing multiple takes of a song, he gets maximum production on minimal time. Jay-Z is a model of efficiency. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Album Consistency</b> - A byproduct of being a consummate 
professional in the studio, Jay-Z has an unusually high 
rate of productivity. <i>Reasonable Doubt </i>came out in 1996, 
which means that he has been rapping as a professional 
for sixteen years. If you count his collaborative albums 
with R.Kelly, Linkin Park, and Kanye West, Jay-Z has 
released fifteen albums. This neither includes the dozens 
of guest appearances he has made on other's songs nor 
<i>Jay-Z</i>: <i> Unplugged</i>, his live album with The Roots. Also, 
bear in mind that he briefly retired from rap in 2004-05. 
So really, he has made fifteen albums in roughly fifteen 
years, a solid 1:1 album-to-year ratio. I can honestly say 
that all of his solo albums are at least good, but most are 
great. Depending on who you ask, at least two of his albums are classics. By this standard, Jay-Z is arguably the 
most prolific modern musician of the moment. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Stage Hustle</b> - A ticket to a Jay-Z concert anywhere in 
the world is a hot item. He doesn't just sell out Madison 
Square Garden; he can sell out any venue on the globe. 
But Jay-Z has a rabid following for more reasons than 
just his name and music. It's because he is an exceptional 
performer. Talk to anyone who has ever been to a Jay-Z 
concert and they will confirm this. More than just a guy 
reciting lyrics on stage, he knows how to engage with an 
audience and get them involved with the music. He is a 
true showman. Tickets to his concerts may be pricey, but 
he makes the experience worth every penny. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Expanding Roc-A-Fella</b> - Being the co-founder and Ceo
of Roc-A-Fella Records, as well as being The Roc's topselling artist, brought Jay-Z immense wealth. But rather 
than just enjoy the money, he pushed the envelope. He 
transformed Roc-A-Fella from a label into a brand. RocA-Fella signed an impressive roster of rappers and did a 
masterful job marketing them. They branched out into 
fashion with Rocawear and film with RoC films. If it 
could turn a profit, they got involved with it. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Continued Business Acumen</b> - It's one thing to make 
good business decisions within the context of a company, 
but it's another thing to make good business decisions on 
one's own. As an individual businessman outside of RocA-Fella, Jay-Z is brilliant. Successful club owner (no small 
feat considering how difficult it is to own a club or restaurant). Former President of Def Jam Records. Part-owner 
of the Brooklyn nets, and a significant figure in moving 
the nets from new Jersey to his hometown. Co-Brand 
Director for Budweiser Select. He chooses his ventures 
wisely and brings the same hustle to those as he does his 
music. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Public Opinions </b>- It is said that opinions are bad for business, which is why many celebrities avoid being vocal 
about certain topics. But Jay-Z is no stranger to controversial opinions, and he has bumped heads with some powerful people. He called for boycott against Cristal when 
managing director Frederic Rouzaud made a disrespectful comment about the hip-hop community consuming 
the product. He challenged noel Gallagher of oasis and 
other rockers when Gallagher opposed Jay-Z performing 
at Glastonbury. He boycotted the Grammy's in 1998 because DMX wasn't nominated for Best Rap Album. Yet 
in Jay-Z's case, these controversies only improved his stature. Why? Because he stood up for something important. 
In each occasion, he voiced his opinions in defense of hip 
hop music. Against Cristal, he defended an attack on the 
hip-hop community. Against noel Gallagher, he defended 
the right of hip hop musicians to perform alongside rock 
musicians. Against the Grammy's, he defended a rapper 
who was perhaps viewed as too hardcore. His willingness 
to stand up for the art form makes him a true ambassador 
of hip-hop.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Philanthropy </b>- Lots of hustlers talk about giving back to 
the community once they have made their fortune, but 
Jay-Z actually does it. Visits to Africa. Meeting with the 
United nations. Donating to the Red Cross during Hurricane Katrina. Performing free of charge in voter-drive 
concerts. Donating to charities such as The Boys &amp; Girls 
Clubs of America, Artists for Peace and Justice, The 
Grammy Foundation, and many other organizations. Jay 
gives a lot, and this is just what is public knowledge. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Undercover Hustle</b> - In the first verse of "Ride or Die," 
Jay-Z boasts, "S. Carter, Ghost writer/ And for the right 
price, I can even make yo sh*t tighter/" This track revealed what few people knew at the time and many still 
don't know: Jay-Z is a prolific ghost writer. From hip hop 
to pop, he has penned a lot of songs for others, many of 
which have become hits. From Dr. Dre to Foxy Brown, he 
gets paid a lot of money for his work. He also has some 
low-key production credits on a few albums. Check out the 
liner notes for some of the popular rap and R&amp;B albums 
in the last decade and a half. You might be surprised how 
many times the name "Shawn Carter" or "S. Carter" appears in the song credits. </p>
<p>Jay-Z has a famous quote in "Diamonds Are Forever (Remix);" "Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week." That 
statement is precisely what makes him great. He is a highschool dropout, but he is intelligent and driven in ways that 
cannot be quantified. All of his success comes from his ability 
to accomplish goals with smarts, effort, and persistence, even 
against the odds. What he says is true. You can't knock the 
hustle.</p>

<h3>music</h3>
<b><h2>Is it possible at this stage of human 
culture to create a new genre of 
music?</h2>
Josh Siegle, PhD student at MIT<br/>
At the risk of sounding incredibly foolish one day, I'm gonna 
go with "no" on this one.</b><br/>
others have answered with a resounding "YeS." Some 
<p>have based their responses on historical precedent: there 
are genres today that didn't exist in the past, so there will 
be genres in the future that don't exist today. others have 
offered specific examples &mdash;folktronica, dubstep, garage &mdash; 
that evolved out of previous genres, but now seem to stand by 
themselves. Some have even suggested that asking the question in the first place betrays a lack of faith in humanity.</p>
<p>I would like to argue for the opposite position: 
<b>all the 
genres of music that will ever be created already exist in 
some form. </b>All future music will be classifiable as a subclass 
or a hybrid of present-day genres.</p>
<p>Clearly this perspective will be controversial, so let me 
start out with some disclaimers. First of all, the answer to 
this question hinges on how we define the word "genre." If 
it's nothing more than a label applied to a group of musicians with similar styles or goals, then obviously there will be 
uncountably many more genres in the future. People love to 
categorize and classify music, and everyone wants to be the 
first to lay claim to the "next big thing" by naming a genre of 
their own. But if we define "genre" as a collection of music 
that contains ideas, attitudes, or sounds that stand apart from 
anything produced previously, the question at hand is no longer inane, but profound.</p>
<p>Secondly, although I believe it's right, I sincerely hope 
that my response is wrong. I hope that the boundaries of music will continue to expand, and that we will see as many new, 
wholly unique genres in the next century as we have in the 
last. However, I think there are logical reasons to believe that 
this won't happen.</p>
<p>There have been two developments in recent music history 
that justify the claim that no new genres are forthcoming. 
Taken together, these two mutually exclusive occurrences signal that we have, in a way, reached the end of music history:</p>
1. the rise of conceptual music
<p>By conceptual music, I mean music that places greater weight 
on ideas than on pleasing rhythms, harmonies, or melodies. 
examples of this include the work of Arnold Schoenberg, 
John Cage, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and styles such as 
free jazz, noise rock, and musique concr&egrave;te. The reason this 
development is crucial is that it extended the boundaries of 
music as far as they can possibly go &mdash; up to the border of 
meaningless sound. After conceptual music gained traction, 
literally anything could be called music, including a performer going onstage and playing nothing at all, as in Cage's infamous "4'33"." There was no longer an aesthetic difference 
between music and pure sound; rather, music could only be 
distinguished by a difference in intention.</p>
<p>This echoes the ideas that philosopher Arthur Danto had 
about visual art: after Andy Warhol produced art objects that 
were indistinguishable from their everyday counterparts, any 
purely formal distinction between art and non-art was impossible. I think the same is true of music; once <i>any</i> sound can be 
classified as art, there are no more sonic boundaries to be broken. Indeed, it seems that every end of the aural spectrum has 
already been reached. From silence to grating noise, mindless drone to pure randomness, street sounds to re-recorded 
music, every extreme of musical possibility has been covered. 
What's more, contemporary music now reaches every corner 
of the <i>attitude</i> spectrum. Music can be reverent or impudent, 
rational or illogical, transcendental or mundane. It's true that 
these ideas have existed in music throughout history, but they 
haven't been taken to their logical extremes like they have 
in the past century. If the boundaries of music have been expanded as far as they can go, the question, then, is can we find 
something new somewhere in the middle?</p>
2. the aBility to digitally synthesiZe sounds
<p>The birth of new genres often coincides with the discovery of 
new sonic possibilities. The most iconic example is the invention of the electric guitar leading to rock'n'roll. An even more 
radical departure occurred in the 1970s when the ability to 
synthesize tones out of pure electricity was democratized. This 
enabled the proliferation of electronic music, which sounded 
radically different than anything that came before it. But analog synthesis was limited in many ways; the real endpoint of 
sonic possibility came with the invention and subsequent perfection of digital sound synthesis.</p>
<p>People typically think of computer-generated music as cold 
and calculated, but the fact of the matter is that most of the 
backing tracks for today's popular music are created entirely 
with computers. Digital music workstations dominate the 
industry because they are affordable, versatile, and, in most 
cases, indistinguishable from analog ones. Purists will always 
claim that analog still sounds better, which is undeniable in 
certain instances, but today's best algorithms for modeling 
pianos, organs, and even guitars inside a computer are just 
about perfect. of course, we could make perfect piano sounds 
before the rise of computers. The real advantage of computers 
is that they can produce sounds that were <i>impossible to make 
before</i>. You can simulate the actions of any instrument while 
tweaking parameters in fanciful ways. You can run any waveform through any filter, turn it into a loop, stretch it, slice it, 
and pump it through a vintage amplifier, all in the same piece 
of software. For the first time in history, it's possible to create 
any sound imaginable, which means pretty much any sound.</p>
what this means for the future of music
<p>If music has used up all its big ideas, and no new sounds will 
be created that can't be created today, what do we have in 
store? Just new permutations of sounds and ideas. Thankfully, 
this leaves us with practically limitless musical possibilities. 
But I don't think there will be new genres that stand entirely 
apart from those that currently exist. one can quibble about 
where to draw today's musical boundaries, but the ubiquity 
of conceptual music and digital synthesis guarantee that any 
music of the future will live within or across the same boundaries.</p>
<p>Like I said before, I hope I'm wrong about this. But I can't 
imagine any radically new ideas or sounds coming into the 
music world, given the arguments outlined above.</p>

<h3>moBile phones</h3>
<b><h2>Why don't cell phones work at 
music festivals?</h2>
Mark Rogowsky, Entrepreneur, raconteur, @maxrogo</b><br/>
Because  the  network  is  overloaded . . .
oh  wait . . .
<p>Here's the problem with lots of people using cell phones in 
a crowded space: there's actually remarkably little spectrum 
available for mobile-phone use, only a few hundred MHz total 
in any one part of the world, and that's usually parceled out 
among a few carriers and not typically shared unless your carrier's spectrum is literally out of range, as opposed to merely 
overcrowded.</p>
it's hard to provide coverage at all
<p>The reason why cell phones work at all in a place like new 
York or Chicago &mdash; or the much harder challenges of say Beijing or Mexico City &mdash; is that the spectrum is re-used over and 
over and over by having multiple cell sites use the same frequencies. now, there are limitations to this. You can't simply 
place two sites next to each other and re-use the frequencies. 
In fact, typically, if you <i>did</i> place two radios adjacent to one 
another, you might do something like put channels A, C, and 
e on one and B, D, and F on the other one. offset them by 
a few degrees and then do the same thing in the opposite direction. What this would do is allow you to re-use channel A 
fairly cleverly, especially with <i>sector antennas </i>which broadcast 
the channel in a pie-piece shaped pattern as opposed to out in 
all directions. Basically, sector antennas are essential to channel/frequency re-use.</p>
<p>now, at Coachella or the equivalent, a company like 
AT&amp;T might literally bring in some extra micro-cell sites to 
try to get some frequency re-use, but the idea there's are going to bring perfect re-use is silly. The big sites atop buildings 
or mountains go through sophisticated engineering studies to 
ensure the maximal re-use without overlapping the channel 
areas [1]. The little sites they drop in at Coachella, well, they 
are dropped in by smart techs who attempt to figure out where 
they'll do the most good using spectrum analyzers, judgment 
of the physical obstacles and guesses at where people will be 
congregating &mdash; the more people in one place, the more challenging to offer them reliable service.</p>
networks are inefficient today By nature
<p>So we mentioned that networks use a carrier's own spectrum 
and can't use another carrier's (with some rare exceptions). 
But it gets worse. AT&amp;T has a fair amount of spectrum and 
let's say all the spectrum at 850MHz is overloaded with voice 
calls and they want to just offload some to their excellent 
700MHz spectrum (lower frequencies travel farther, penetrate walls better, etc.). oops. no go. That spectrum is locked 
into the 4G LTe network and can't be repurposed on the fly. 
And, really, your phone has no radio that allows for a currentgeneration voice call to be placed on it anyway. </p>
<p>There is some clear spectrum at 1900 MHz, maybe, that 
your call could complete on, but that spectrum is higher frequency, and it isn't getting through the metal cage that is 
forming the structure you're in. Alas. Your call has dropped.</p>
<p>now, someday, this will change. First of all, voice will migrate to something called Voice over LTe. That will mean 
that all calls will be data, like VoIP calls today (e.g. Skype, 
Vonage, etc.). They will be frequency agile wherever the 4G 
network is on whatever bands. However, that nirvana is years 
away because today's AT&amp;T (or Verizon or T-Mobile or really 
anyway) is a hodgepodge of chunks of bandwidth locked into 
specific purposes. Some of those purposes are somewhat agile. For example, AT&amp;T's original 3G W-CDMA/UMTS can 
share spectrum with its HSPDA 3G+/quasi 4G network. But 
those can't share spectrum with the true 4G network, which 
can't share spectrum with the voice network, etc. etc. [2]</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are entering a period where Qualcomm 
(and eventually others) are just shipping second-generation 
LTe silicon for handsets. That silicon is still not capable of 
supporting the dozen or so frequency bands that use LTe in 
the world. But a generation or two more, and it likely will be. 
A fully frequency agile solution [3] has implications not just 
for individual carriers, but for roaming and for what the FCC 
hopes is a very different future in the U.S.</p>
&ldquo;it's  my  spectrum,  But . . . &rdquo;
<p>A lot of spectrum in the U.S. belongs to branches of the government &mdash; most notably DoD &mdash; and other entities that don't 
use said spectrum very often. Wouldn't it be nice if they could 
loan it out to others who could use it and then grab it back in 
real time when they needed it? Well, the FCC sure thinks so. 
The agency envisions that smart folks can develop <i>cognitive 
radios</i> that will be able to ask if the spectrum is free, use it 
when it is, and leave it behind when the licensee needs it. This 
might well happen over the next decade. </p>
<p>Similarly, this technology should allow devices like cell 
phones to also query unlicensed bands like WiFi's 802.11 a 
and b/g bands to see if they can be used &mdash; all in real time [4].</p>
oh, and what aBout your question<font size="-2">?</font>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i> SMS, aka your text messages: </i>They are tiny amounts of 
data, but the network by default also gives them the lowest possible priority. They are likely to get through, but if a 
network is truly slammed, they might fall below real-time 
delivery. It's worth noting that as texting has become so 
ubiquitous it seems carriers have done a bit of work to 
avoid the delays of old and keep texting useful even under 
load. Why? Because when calls aren't going through this 
keeps customers happy. But I add this last thought anecdotally; I'm not sure if they are actually increasing traffic 
prioritization.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i> Voice calls: </i>Most networks try to avoid even completing these if the call won't work. "I tried you and it went 
straight to voice mail." That happens sometimes because 
the network doesn't believe you &mdash; the recipient &mdash; will be 
able to hear or talk to the other person. "Believe" here is 
not some AI, but rather, the network doesn't find you with 
sufficient signal strength or it doesn't have the bandwidth 
on voice channels to make the call work.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Data: </i> on Verizon, in my experience, data never goes 
down. But it can get really, really, really slow. In fact, it 
can kick me from the 3G network to the old 1X network 
which &mdash; even when clear &mdash; is slow enough to be unusable 
for a lot of activities. I'm not sure how it works on AT&amp;T, 
but I'd bet it's similar. The thing about data is that cellular 
data really closely resembles the way the internet itself 
works: everything is packetized and your "connection" is 
constantly opening and closing. For this reason &mdash; and unlike a voice call &mdash; it's hard to be completely shut out from 
joining the network, but it's quite possible for the network 
to become really overcrowded.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[1]</font>
 There's a gigantic caveat here which is that technically, 
your calls and data usage are always in overlapping coverage zones. Why? Because you might be in a moving vehicle 
or the area you are in might suddenly become overloaded. 
This handoff from one cell tower to another is part of the 
magic that separates cell service when its precursor, radiotelephone service, which led to some really bad AT&amp;T/
McKinsey decision-making at the time of the 1983 AT&amp;T 
divestiture . . . But I digress . . .</p>
<p><font size="-1">[2]</font>
 To be honest, this is probably worse than I can imagine. 
But at least it's better than when half the spectrum was 
tied up in spectrally inefficient analog, which is mostly 
(entirely?) gone in the U.S. The move away from analog 
is proof the networks can get better . . . And they will keep 
getting better.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[1]</font>
 Hard defined here, not software-defined radio, which 
would be even better, but might be one of those technologies that is always "five years away."</p>
<p><font size="-1">[2]</font>
 Your smartphone already kind of does this for data use if 
it finds a friendly WiFi network. In the future, so-called 
"WiFi on Steroids" in the old UHF TV bands might 
greatly expand the available of wide-area WiFi networks, 
however, and this technology becomes exponentially more 
interesting to carriers as a complement to their networks.</p>

<h3>violins</h3>
<b><h2>How do you know when to switch 
positions on the violin?</h2>
Jess Lin, violinist in the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra</b>
<p>There is no single correct place to shift, but when deciding on 
whether to shift &mdash; and more generally, when deciding on fingerings &mdash; you should think about the following things (some 
of which are interrelated):</p>
do you want to shift<font size="-2">?</font>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Sound quality:</b> Do you want a brighter sound or a thicker, 
richer sound? You get the richness in higher positions. 
one common example of when you'd consider sound quality is in deciding whether to use an open string or to use 
the fingered equivalent on a lower string. (While you may 
not have to shift to reach this note &mdash; it's a fourth finger, 
first position &mdash; this comparison gives you the idea. Play 
it for yourself.) When considering sound quality, you also 
want to think about consistency. If you're playing a phrase 
in which all the notes are on one string except for the last 
one, that last note will stand out. This is especially true on 
higher-pitched strings.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> String crossings: </b>Sometimes, shifting will prevent you 
from making string crossings. This could be nice if there 
are, say, a line of fast (and especially repetitive) running 
notes that could be played easily on one string if you just 
move up a position or two. But sometimes, we <i>want </i> repetitive string crossings for an effect (e.g. think waves, 
water) &mdash; this comes up more often in music for ensembles 
(orchestral, chamber music).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Necessity: </b>For notes higher than first position on the e
string, you have no other option. Also, sometimes composers specify that a passage should be played on a particular 
string, which may force you to shift.</p>
where to shift<font size="-2">?</font>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Distance between the notes of a shift:</b> Typically, you may 
have better accuracy if you shift between notes that are 
closer together (e.g. half steps rather than whole steps). 
This is a heuristic and not a hard and fast rule, though, 
and I violate this heuristic all the time. Sometimes there's 
an alternative that just feels more natural in my hand.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Location in the music: </b>Generally, it's easier to hide a shift
in between phrases or slurs, rather than in the middle of 
one. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Making your life easier: </b>Related to the above. Sometimes 
shifting in one place makes playing the passage that follows it easier. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Slides:</b> Sometimes, for musical reasons, you don't want to 
hide the shift, and want to emphasize the transition between two notes with a little <i>schmeer </i>(just made that word 
up, btw). This consideration also affects whether or not to 
do the shift in the first place.</p>
general concerns
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Comfort/physical limitation:</b> Different shifts and fingerings just feel better for different people, either due to 
things you've practiced, the size of your hand, etc. Pick 
whatever feels best for you. Sometimes you can shift to use 
a stronger finger instead of the weaker pinky.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Your skill level:</b> All of this advice is nice in theory, but 
it's a different story in practice (ha). For instance, you do 
in theory get a nice thick sound in a higher position, but 
it's also much harder to produce a good tone quality in a 
higher position. It takes years of practice to get a feel for 
it. If you're not there yet and want to perform a piece, you 
may opt for not shifting up (though you should practice 
the shift up anyway to improve your skills).</p>
some examples to consider
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Professionals play the first nineteen bars of the second 
movement of the Brahms Violin Sonata no. 3 entirely on 
the G string, even though in first position the notes would 
range over the G, D, and A strings. You want that chocolatey richness of the G string, you want consistency of the 
sound quality, and you want to stay on the same string to 
make it easier to smooth out the phrase.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The first two notes of the second movement of the Strauss 
Violin Sonata (an <i>E-flat</i> and then a <i>C</i>) could be played in 
first position on the D and A strings, but everyone shifts 
up on the D string for that <i>C</i>. You can hear that desirable 
little <i>schmeer </i>as Sarah Chang makes that e-flat just <i>reach 
up for </i>that C.</p>
<p>Also, I was just looking at the second violin part for Dvorak's 
"American" String Quartet [1], and just the first few measures 
are perfect for illustrating some of the points above.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Let's look at the third measure. You certainly do not want 
to play that with an open A string in first position &mdash; the A 
would be too bright <b>[sound quality]</b>, and there would be 
an awful lot of <b>string crossings</b>, which are too bumpy for 
the desired texture here. So, you could play this in first position with your fourth and second fingers (i.e. pinky and 
middle finger). But many people prefer to swap out the 
weaker fourth for the stronger third <b>[comfort/physical 
limitation]</b>. So, I suspect most people play that passage 
in second position. But then, you have to get there . . . Given what comes before, this means you want to be on the 
D string already. So you would shift right at the start of 
the first measure, in order to have a natural shift down to 
second position. (Actually, you wouldn't want to play the 
first measure in first position anyway, to avoid the open A 
string <b>[sound quality]</b>.) notice that this part has a "2" at 
the start &mdash; so, this person has chosen to use the second 
finger and "weaker" fourth finger &mdash; but this only lasts for 
two measures, so it's not too bad. The notes starting at the 
third measure go on for eight measures, though, so that's 
why you might chose to do a "3-1" instead.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
okay, one more example. Look at the fourth line, third 
measure. You know you have to shift up to third position 
<i>somewhere</i> because of that high D <b>[necessity]</b>, but you risk 
schmeering the shift if you do it in the middle of those 
slurred sixteenth notes (and a schmeer is a bad thing, 
here, because you want clarity) <b>[location in the music]</b>. 
So, shift before. note that there's a "1" written on that first 
D, so you're already in third position at the start of that 
measure. The musician who put in fingerings for this part 
actually decides to go up to third position in the first measure of the fourth line &mdash; see that "2" &mdash; and that's a nice 
way to do it.</p>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re a middle-aged, upper-middle-class male. You 
live in a large metropolitan area. You have a good job. Your 
wife does Pilates. Your oldest just started kindergarten. Yes, 
you&rsquo;re an adult, but you&rsquo;re still cool! Your jeans cost one hundred and twenty five dollars. Sometimes, you wear sneakers 
with a blazer! </p>
<p>You like the idea of being a guy who&rsquo;s into live music, but 
the last few concerts you&rsquo;ve been to were (a) too loud, (b) too 
crowded, (c) too foreign (you were lucky if you recognized 
one song). You&rsquo;ll snap a few photos with your smartphone 
and tell your bros about it to get some street cred, but let&rsquo;s 
face it: you didn&rsquo;t enjoy yourself. There are millions of you. 
And you&rsquo;re willing to drop cash to have a concert make you 
feel cool again.</p>

<p>Then you learn that U2 is coming to town &mdash; U2! earnest, 
melodic, oprah-endorsed U2! $200 a ticket? no problem. You 
get a sitter. Your wife is excited &mdash; this is going to be great! 
You invite some friends from college to join you.</p>
<p>on the way, you listen to the &ldquo;early stuff.&rdquo; 
<i>The Joshua Tree</i>
pumps through the speakers of your Lexus SUV (no judgment &mdash; you have two kids!). The harmonies soothe. The lyrics 
are straightforward. You recall a simpler time before car seats 
and prostate exams. The nostalgia is so thick you have to wipe 
it from your face. You haven&rsquo;t looked at your phone in nearly 
eleven minutes.</p>
<p>You arrive at the show and see yourself everywhere. Tasteful north Face and Patagonia jackets abound. The stands are 
awash in earth tones. no one is shoving. no one has a nose 
ring. These are your people. </p>

<p>The band begins with A SonG YoU ReCoGnIZe! You&rsquo;re 
on your feet. You&rsquo;re drinking &ldquo;craft&rdquo; beer. everyone is singing terribly. </p>
<p>And the best part &mdash; YoU CAn DAnCe HeRe! eighty 
thousand people surround you and there&rsquo;s not a coordinated movement in sight. even the band sets a low bar. Bono 
doesn&rsquo;t so much dance as lunge and bounce. The other guys 
seem content to nod and rock. All around you, middle-aged 
people are rocking and lunging and bouncing and singing 
badly. Is that guy wearing Tod&rsquo;s loafers and a Barbour jacket? 
Yes, he is. And he&rsquo;s in the zone.</p>
<p>The set is basically a greatest hits playlist. The band graciously performs two new songs that no one recognizes to give 
you a few minutes to use the john and grab another IPA. They 
might as well flash an intermission sign. </p>
<p>even the political statements go down smooth: &ldquo;Democracy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight AIDS!&rdquo; How could you possibly disagree? 
You&rsquo;re not only dancing and reminiscing &mdash; you&rsquo;re spreading 
freedom and reasonably-priced medicines to distant lands! </p>
<p>And the kicker: not one, but TWo encores, the ones you 
know best &mdash; the ones you first heard that summer you painted 
houses or kissed Katie at the beach party. You&rsquo;re closing your 
eyes now. This is sad and sweet. You put your arm around your 
wife. You&rsquo;re wondering if Katie ever got married. A third of 
the crowd departs after the first encore. It&rsquo;s no big deal; some 
of us have work in the morning! Anyway, the traffic will be 
better if everyone doesn't leave at once.</p>

<h3>snipers</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be a sniper?</h2>
Michael Janke, Author, Navy SEAL Sniper, CEO, Privacy 
Advocate, Philospher</b>
<p>not an easy question to answer &mdash; almost uncomfortable for 
me. I am not quite sure how to address such a personal question . . . I recognize the fascination that the public has with 
this strange profession &amp; skill &mdash; both morbid and sensationalized at the same time. So here goes.</p>
<p>As a 12-year SeAL and Sniper, I spent the better part of 
my adult life learning, using, refining, and living this skill, 
yet I find it difficult to put into words "what it is like to be a 
sniper". In the Teams, older snipers and team leaders look 
for more "solitary and quiet" individuals that have focus and 
a "quiet" about them. Some individuals have a "comfortable 
knack" and a natural feel for navigating any environment unseen &mdash; the training takes this "knack" to a whole new level. 
An additional skill that is sought-out, honed, and refined is 
something we call "Bubble Compartmentalization" &mdash; or the 
ability to block everything else out for long periods of time, 
except specific visual and observation skills &mdash; basically the 
ability to sit still, observe, and calculate without losing your 
mind.</p>
<p>There is nothing glorious or sexy about the job. It is very 
hard on your body &mdash; and it&rsquo;s not something you would want 
to chat about at a cocktail party. In my experience, people 
already have a formed opinion of what type of person you 
must be, what morals you have, and that you must be a little 
"off," long before you even meet them. You spend days crawling, climbing, slinking, stinking, getting bitten by every bug, 
scratched by every thicket, attempting to relieve yourself 
while laying on your side, looking through night vision or 
scopes for endless hours, sleeping in fifteen minute bursts, 
just to get to a "target area." once on the target area, you do 
the business of a sniper, usually in support of a SeAL assault 
team that comes in fast and hard in helicopters, then fastrope 
down onto the target, take it down, then board and fly away. 
now your work begins again, exfiltration, the art of getting 
out of the target area (sometimes with some very angry enemies running around trying to figure out what happened). </p>
<p>There are so many different skill sets that need to be constantly refined as Sniper tactics, equipment, weather, enemy 
and ballistic trajectories change dramatically in an UrbanSniper role. It is one thing to be able to hide in a jungle with 
vast areas of cover and concealment, it is an entirely other 
thing to be an effective sniper in a City or Urban Warfare 
environment. The difficulty factor goes way up. The amount 
of practice, study, and hours spent mastering every type of environment (shooting from buildings, helicopters, ships, shooting thru glass, walls, different mathematical calculations for 
temperature, humidity, altitude, load, etc . . . it is a non-stop 
learning game in addition to your other SeAL missions. </p>
<p>When I tell people that there are many complementary 
skill sets as a Sniper and a Ceo of a company, they think I 
am absolutely crazy, but there are many. A good Ceo is there 
to "support" his team and help make them look good. not the 
other way around. To defer attention . . . and not be a jackass. 
The ability to focus on getting from A to B without being distracted, the ability to operate and maintain a company's focus 
through constant changes, and adapting rather than causing 
panic. The ability to not have an ego in the game at hand and 
not make the mission, goal, or success "about me," but rather 
about everyone else. To use your power only when the moment is required, not flaunting it for all to see. </p>
<p>I apologize if this long-winded answer in the end does not 
give you the "meat and potatoes" of how it feels to be a sniper, 
but I find it extremely hard to clearly articulate something 
so personal and yet job-oriented. There are many good books 
out there that do a hell of a job telling specific stories and giving blow-by-blow accounts of combat sniping missions. I was 
trained on the 50-caliber McMillian and Barrett Sniper Rifle 
by Carlos Hathcock. He was a guest instructor to my sniper 
class, he was a good man and a great teacher. His book is a 
good book to start.</p>

how much money you have, your mom, whatever. Rational 
people can become maniacs if someone pushes their buttons. <br/>

 There are practices people engage in for sexual reasons

gain some limited insight here by going to a reasonablywell-stocked adult bookstore and examining the diversity 
of the materials. If your thing is watching overweight 
Asian women give each other enemas, there are not just 
other people who enjoy the same thing, there is probably a 
regular magazine and series of videos devoted to it. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
no matter how bizarre you find other folks' sexual preferences, you have to be at peace with knowing that what 
consenting adults do in private is their business alone. If 
they decide to take it public or engage people who either 
don't consent or are too young to do so, you can get involved. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Law enforcement is a very stressful occupation, but most 
of the stress comes from the political interactions and 
power games within each law enforcement agency. The 
stuff on the street can be stressful, but you learn to deal 
with that quickly or you get out. About half of the people 
who become law enforcement officers leave before they 
have five years on the job. Some get fired for unsuitability, 
incompetence, or misconduct, but others find out it's just 
not for them. </p>

Many criminals can be reformed, and eventually do come 
to the point in their lives that a criminal lifestyle is more

<h3>law enforcement and the police</h3>
<b><h2>What's the best way to escape the 
police in a high-speed car chase?</h2>
Justin Freeman, Former Patrol Officer</b>
<p>Simple: 
<b>Elude law enforcement in a jurisdiction with a strict 
pursuit policy.</b> In my department, unless a suspect vehicle 
was an obvious DWI (swerving white line to white line, erratic speed changes) or had committed a violent felony, vehicle pursuits got cancelled by a commander almost instantly. 
There is so much liability at play in a pursuit situation that 
many departments are getting very conservative in their response protocols to situations like this. </p>
<p>As far as maneuvering tactics when they're actually pursuing you, there's really no sense diving in &mdash; you've got too many 
things going against you:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Communication. </i>every involved officer, as well as their supervisors and their supervisors' supervisors, have radios, 
both in-car and portable on their person. Can you dial 
your cell phone and drive with one hand at 120 mph while 
you coordinate with accomplices miles down the road? 
Probably not.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Collaboration. </i>If a pursuit has been sanctioned, the longer it goes on, the more officers are going to be in on the 
hunt. And if you stray toward the boundary of a jurisdiction (city limit, county border, and so on), you're going to 
get mutual aid response from other agencies, who may be 
even less restricted than your original pursuers. Have fun 
with that.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Convergence. </i>You can go in one direction at a time, but 
law enforcement response to your location will be omnidirectional. You're going to have Leos swarming your 
vehicle from 360 degrees and, if a helicopter gets tossed 
in the mix, three dimensions. You simply cannot go fast 
enough to counter this. even if you were trying to elude 
the north Dakota Highway Patrol on I-94 in an Italian 
supercar, you've still got a lot of variables to buck regarding interagency cooperation.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Contraptions. </i>Hope you've got solid rubber tires, because 
if the agency gets a lock on your direction of flight, you're 
getting spiked &mdash; and if you hit spikes, you're hosed. You'll 
drive for a while, because spike strips are designed to 
puncture tires so they slowly deflate as opposed to blowing 
out. But once they're flat, driving on them will make them 
disintegrate; then you're driving on rims. now you're limited to fifteen to twenty miles per hour, and you're in danger of your vehicle catching fire from the spraying sparks. 
Meanwhile, the agency is moving the K-9 unit to point 
position so when you shoulder your smoldering jalopy and 
make a run for it, Cujo's got less ground to cover before 
he eats your forearm. Did you think to wear chain mail?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Concentration. </i> How often do you drive in this manner? 
Unless you're running because you're on parole, this is 
likely your first dance. Sure, you've driven fast before &mdash; 
for a while. Then, for whatever reason, you got uncomfortable and backed off. Maybe your car made a sound you got 
concerned about, maybe you caught a glint you thought 
might be a trooper's windshield, maybe you thought you 
heard the faintest pulses of a siren. Whatever it was, it 
weakened your resolve, and you slowed down. You have no 
such luxury here. And while this is fresh for you, this is, 
to many of the people pursuing you, another day another 
dollar. They've trained for this in training scenarios and 
have been involved in pursuits in the field. They run code 
multiple times a week. even if one of your pursuers was 
a rookie who got eaten up by the stress, there will be a 
dozen vets to take his place.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Cognizance. </i> Unless you've lived around and driven on 
your path of flight for decades, I can almost guarantee you 
do not know it as well as your pursuers. I drove a hundred 
miles a night, four nights a week, on the same few dozen 
streets in my beat. I knew every pothole and curbstone, 
every back alley and shortcut. Plus, supplementing my 
knowledge was dispatch, who had a real time, God's eye 
view of the situation, and who could foreshadow upcoming turns based on officers' GPS and current road conditions.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Conveyances. </i>Your chosen city of flight may have the rattiest squad cars in the country, but they have the distinct 
benefit of redundancy. Your escape vehicle is precious, because there is only one. nuke a tire from hitting spikes or 
a pothole, and you're roasted. If a patrol car has a blowout, 
that unit will fall out and be replaced by another. If you 
think your car can outrun and outlast what will effectively 
be an infinite number of responding unit vehicles (when 
you account for interagency involvement), have at it; otherwise, you may need to rethink your day.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Control. </i>What is your flight plan &mdash; are you going to rely 
on top end speed on the open highway? or are you going 
to try to lose responding officers in an intricate series of 
turns? You've got a tall order ahead either way.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
First, if you've got something in your hands that can outperform Crown Victoria and Charger interceptors on the 
interstate, you're going to be relatively easy to spot &mdash; you 
won't be doing this in a stock Toyota. Second, you've got 
Little Brother to worry about &mdash; if you wax someone's 
doors at double the speed limit, they're probably going to 
call the police. Instant update to last known location and 
direction of travel, which allows retriangulation if you 
managed to create space. You probably haven't, though, 
because even with vehicles <i>capable</i> of impressive top end 
speed, there comes a point where the vehicle is so functionally light you can no longer safely operate it in real 
world driving conditions. My top speed running code in a 
Crown Vic was 134 mph, which was frankly stupid &mdash; the 
suspension was floating so badly that driving over a headsup penny probably would have sent me into a terminal 
fishtail. This all means that while you may maintain some 
semblance of distance between yourself and the point car, 
you're very unlikely to be completely leaving them in your 
sonic wake.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Alternately, if you're banking on turns (you got me, pun 
intended), you're going to have to keep your head about 
you. Stress has a tendency to get the better of your attempts at rational thought. <i>Was that three lefts or four? 
This looks familiar, I'd better go the other way . . . was that 
a school crossing sign or a dead end sign? Is Main Street 
continuous this far south? Which side of the tracks am I on? 
Ah, now we're cooking with &mdash; what? Since when is there 
a cul-de-sac here?</i> Game over &mdash; whether that consists of 
walking backward at gunpoint or feeling Cujo getting his 
<i>nom nom nom </i>on.</p>
<p>As you may have gathered, I am of the opinion that there is 
no right answer to this question. Vehicle pursuits never end 
well &mdash; I've never seen an authorized pursuit go down and 
then heard a commander say, "Gee, that was tidy." If the pursuit is terminated by a supervisor, it's bad because the suspect 
got away. If it gets authorized, it's not going to have a pretty 
ending, most likely. The vast majority of the time, the suspect 
ends up needing medical attention by the time it's over. It 
might be for something minor, like flushing pepper spray out 
of your eyes, pulling TASeR barbs out of your flesh, or treating a dog bite. It might be something major, like pronouncing 
you and your two passengers dead after your car hits an oak 
tree at 107 mph (seen it &mdash; decidedly unpretty). Take all the 
liberties you want with your own life and death &mdash; but running 
from the police puts scores of people in harm's way, even for 
a short pursuit.</p>
no matter the charge or the perceived consequences, <i>never run from the police.</i><br/>

<h3>poker</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to earn a living 
through poker?</h2>
Michael Shinzaki, Professional Poker Player</b>
<p>I have played poker on the professional level for the past seven 
years as my only source of income. In that time, I have ridden 
extravagant highs and abysmal lows, financially, emotionally. 
I have gotten to live through a vast range of unique life experiences, fun times, odd situations. Playing poker for a living 
is a roller coaster for sure. There is no set wage. The level of 
difficulty of the game itself can run the gamut from seemingly 
impossible to Midas touch. You can make a year's worth of 
rent in a few hours, or you can go months of full-time play and 
break even, or even lose. </p>
<p>When I began, I never expected to make a livelihood out 
of it. For me, it was a challenging game with an intriguing 
strategy behind it, and I enjoyed the competitiveness and the 
creativity required to play well, just like Scrabble or chess or 
a reasonably fun video game. Back then, that's all it was: just 
simply a game. eventually, after losing small sums here and 
there, I eventually started making a concerted effort to learn 
from my mistakes (going to Borders and reading poker strategy books, watching poker on eSPn, looking at hands I played 
and really trying to figure out how/why/where I was fucking 
up). After several $100 deposits into online poker with my 
debit card, and many sleepless nights just encapsulated with 
the game and playing for hours on end, I found myself suddenly doing well. It felt like when you string together a few 
sessions at the driving range and your swing starts shaping 
back up. of course, this was after countless days failing miserably on the virtual felt, with no clue what I was doing wrong 
or how I should be playing differently. </p>
<p>eventually I started winning, and so with the boost in 
confidence and a curiosity in how far I could progress, I dedicated more hours and energy to improving and moving up in 
stakes. When I was nineteen, I approached a six-figure annual salary playing less than full-time hours per week. At that 
point I was juggling university life with what was transforming into a full-fledged career. When my higher education was 
complete, I had to decide between taking an entry-level job, 
at a severe pay cut, or continue forth with the poker venture. 
I decided that the opportunity was too unique and invigorating to pass up and that I wanted to ride it out as long as I felt 
competitive and enjoyed the game. It was really fascinating, 
and a $40k/year job in a cubicle didn't seem very appealing 
when I was making several hundred dollars an hour playing 
online poker in my pajamas from home in between rounds of 
golf, episodes of entourage on netflix, and happy hours with 
pals. For the most part, I focused on cash games, as they are 
a more consistent influx of winnings than are tournaments, 
which are volatile in results and are laden with variance. I 
focused on cash games for many years, playing when I felt like 
it, and not playing when I didn't feel like it. </p>
<p>This was one of the most amazing benefits of playing poker professionally, no set hours. Some days I would wake up 
and want to play all day, and so I did. other times, I would go 
a week without wanting to get dealt even one hand. Similarly, 
I could play for a few hours, go to the gym or grab a bite or 
hang out with some friends, then play again with later down 
time. Also, when on a downswing, I could take a few days off
and purposely not think about poker at all, so that I could 
come back refreshed and play a better game upon my return. 
And of course, I could craft my personal schedule however I 
deemed necessary. </p>
<p>I personally began using this flexibility to start traveling, 
since I could play online poker from anywhere with internet. I 
started following live poker tournament stops throughout the 
world, places such as Auckland, Melbourne, Las Vegas, Vancouver, and many other cities. As my income rose, so too did 
my expenditures across the board. I updated my wardrobe. I 
traveled to more places (three dozen countries in three years). 
I bought a car and paid it off. I treated my friends well and ate 
at nice places. Sometimes, poker winnings didn't always feel 
'earned' (even though I was cognizant of the work I had put in 
to become a world-class player and knew the earnings to be in 
fact earned) and so spending was easier because it didn't feel 
like parting away with hard-earned money at times.</p>
<p>Most poker players are quick to accentuate or focus on 
their wins but rarely talk about their losses. even when I was 
at the peak of my career, playing my absolute best, putting 
the most time and focus into it, playing the highest stakes, I 
still had many horrendous downswings. I had countless breakeven months. I would win $40k in a week and then drop it 
the next week. My worst session was six hours and I dropped 
$25k. I remember it to this day. I went to grab sushi with a 
friend that night and she lamented that the bill was $40. I 
abstained from describing the poker doom session I had endured earlier that afternoon. </p>
<p>Times like those can be very testing. Most people can only 
relate to what it feels like to lose ten bucks on a hand of blackjack. But it's not just the money factor, although it is a big 
one. It's just simply the constant scrutiny and constant setbacks. Most people's jobs don't involve constant failure where 
you just get kicked to the curb over and over, but if you are 
to accept the long-run nature of poker statistics, you are going to lose all the time if you play a lot. And all I can say is 
there is no other feeling than to play poker as your job and 
lose an exorbitant sum here and there or suffer prolonged 
downswings. You feel like a piece of shit. You question your 
skills and merit. You start to question everything. It is very 
disheartening and discouraging and you start to think about 
all the things you could have bought for yourself or others 
with the money you just lost playing a game of cards. Mostly, 
you actually occasionally envy the people who can just clock in 
and clock out of work and take on no responsibility and suffer 
no duress and receive the same paycheck each week.</p>
<p>of course, that is the inherent trap, because this is absolutely the wrong way to approach the game mentally. And 
so people who cannot harness their emotions usually end up 
having a tough time coping with the downs in poker and ultimately do fail. Poker as a profession is not for people who 
need constant reassurance or encouragement. You really have 
to be brutally honest with your performance and nobody is 
there to help you but yourself. You have to be very hard on 
yourself, and you have to grow calloused to the constant cutthroat nature you voluntarily step into. Someone mentioned 
an estimate that 80% lose in the long run in poker, but I think, 
and have heard, a more accurate statistical guess that only 5% 
win at poker in the long-run, and out of those, only 5% of 
them can live off their winnings. Moral of the story is that 
very, very, very, VeRY few people have shown the ability to 
beat poker over a large sample size. It takes exorbitant mental 
determination to persist through the trials and tribulations 
and taxing nature of poker.</p>
<p>At its best though, poker as a profession is unbeatable. 
There is no better profession in terms of the capacity to bolster your quality of living with the least sacrifice or downside. Literally unbeatable, aside from inheriting a fortune or 
something, and even then there is the argument that poker 
is better because you are feeling competitive and can focus 
on something. Many poker players are jaded and unhappy 
individuals, but many too are not. Using your life situation 
(of which income and time are variables, but not the entire 
equation) is a skill entirely separate from card playing. If you 
are good, though, there are endless seas of money just waiting to be had. You can make a LoT of money playing poker, 
but yet have the time and capability to do unique things with 
your life. You have to realize that most people in this world 
are condemned to pretty mundane lives. Countless millions 
of people will have to work retail, customer service, things 
like that for meager salaries for their entire lives with two 
weeks off a year, and even those individuals are luckier than a 
proverbial infinite amount of others. Poker is not a cake walk, 
and it's not a dream life devoid of any concerns, but it can 
catalyze at a reasonable frequency a life that most people can 
only dream of (me included when I began).</p>
<p>The flexibility is the best part. You can be wherever you 
want for the most part. You can make time for your friends 
and family. You can sleep in. You can craft your schedule 
around your hobbies and outside interests. You can travel and 
take vacations whenever you want. These things are HUGe
in the grand scheme of life and happiness and are things that 
most people in the workforce can only wonder about as some 
lofty conjured pipe dream that is unattainable. At its best, 
poker as a career didn't always feel like real life. It felt unfair, like some cosmic loophole that nobody else was seeing. 
I once made $109k in one day, when I was twenty-one years 
old. Some people never make half that in a year. And what 
did I do to deserve that? Just some study here and there in a 
pedestrian game of cards. My previous job before poker was 
at Baskin Robbins where I made $6.75+tips/hour. Suddenly, I 
found myself jetting all over the world for tournaments, meeting interesting people, staying at nice hotels, eating at nice 
places, wearing nice clothes, and more importantly being able 
to pursue my hobbies and interests on the side, such as blogging, acting school, and various sports.</p>
<p>The only downside to poker is a lack of fulfillment when 
it comes to feeling constructive and productive. Anybody who 
can battle the competitive arena of poker and come out ahead 
has to have some inherent creativity, creative energy, or just 
mental wherewithal in general and there has to be something 
or some way in this world for that to be channeled for something bigger and greater than being good at a game. This last 
reason/caveat is precisely the reason that my poker career is 
now over and I am looking on to the next chapter of life. But, 
when it lasted, and at its highs, poker taught me a ton of life 
skills, things I will keep with me forever. It forced me to grow 
up at a young age and be involved with stressful, marginal decisions involving a lot of money against opponents who would 
leave me for dead if it was their choice. I am more attuned to 
social cues and ebbs and flows due to poker. I am more analytical and methodical when making decisions due to poker. 
Poker as a job was stressful but it prepared me to move forth, 
and while it lasted, allowed me to fashion an extravagant and 
unique start to my adult life and have an exorbitant, unbelievable amount of fun.</p>

<h3>doctors</h3>
<b><h2>Why does it seem most doctors are 
not compassionate?</h2>
Lou Davis, Ever such a long time in ED</b>
<p>one Sunday a few years ago, one of my colleagues Dan was 
dealing with trauma in our resuscitation room. It had been a 
terrible week, as the summer was coming to an end and the 
leaves on the trees were beginning to turn brown, we had 
already dealt with three fatalities from motorcycle accidents.</p>
<p>By some quirk of 'fate,' Dan (at that time probably twentyseven years old) had dealt with all of these individuals. All of 
them under forty years of age. Dan was (is) a deeply compassionate man, caring and helpful. So, after he had tried to 
save these lives, and failed, he insisted on going to inform the 
families himself.</p>
<p>There was a woman with two young children, a younger brother of another. He sat quietly and told these families 
that he had been unsuccessful, that their loved one had died, 
suddenly, tragically. each time he walked from the room, he 
looked less like Dan, he started to look 'haunted.'</p>
<p>Death is the ultimate 'insult' in many ways to those of us 
who choose to specialize in emergency Medicine. Dan had 
been challenged, and in his eyes, he had failed.</p>
<p>Sunday awakened, crystal clear blue skies. The slight smell 
of wood smoke in the air. The last gasp of summer. And we 
knew that the week wasn't over when we heard the insistent 
bell of our 'red phone.' Another motorcyclist, taking advantage of the wonderful day. </p>
<p>Dan swung into action, confident, capable. When I say 
that he wouldn't have worked harder for one of his own family, I mean it. He was determined. The patient died, as he put it 
to the man's wife some minutes later 'despite our best efforts.'</p>
<p>He was to say it twice more that day. Two more families to 
add to the total that Dan had already dealt with during that 
bleak week. We sat together that evening, Dan weeping with 
sorrow, with frustration, at what he felt was his failure, his 
impotence.</p>
<p>There were many more occasions when Dan had to break 
bad news, had to tell people that they had something terribly 
wrong with them, or with their relative.</p>
<p>I have seen him change, he is still the 'Dan' I know and 
love, but he is different. He is different because he has to protect himself. </p>
<p>It isn't that he lacks compassion, not at all. He genuinely 
feels pain and sadness but he has built a 'shell' around himself 
because our job is hard. In many ways, it is the hardest job.</p>
<p>Dan became a Doctor because he cares about people, he 
wants to help, he wants to alleviate suffering but, when all is 
said and done, he is human &mdash; as I am, as all of our colleagues 
are. We may all 'appear' to lack compassion, we may seem 
'hard,' 'uncaring,' 'unfeeling.' I can assure you, that in MoST 
cases that is not true. We have to learn how to cope with seeing and hearing things that, hopefully, most people would not 
be able to conceive. </p>
<p>I cry frequently, occasionally I will cry with families of 
patients, often I cry at home, at night, in the dark. I have seen 
suffering. I care, Dan cares but we have to do this so often 
that we develop a way which allows us to cope, to carry on.</p>
<p>This perhaps is not the answer that others will give, I 
would say 'walk a mile in our shoes,' we are not perfect, we 
have a long way to go but we do this job BeCAUSe we care 
and we are only human.</p>

<h3>aircraft carriers</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be the 
commanding officer of an Aircraft 
Carrier?</h2>
Yank Rutherford, RADM U.S. Navy (ret)</b>
<p>Carriers are a unique representation of national strength. As 
they operate around the globe in response to the national 
Command Authority, they are often the most visible manifestation of America&rsquo;s military power, technology, and the 
resolve and talent of our people. Worldwide, our friends and 
foes fully appreciate the impact a carrier&rsquo;s war-fighting capability has on the balance of power during conflict &mdash; from minor contingency operations to major theater-level combat. The 
multi-billion dollar carrier, its complement of multi-million 
dollar aircraft, and a crew of more than five thousand Sailors and Marines represent a large investment of our national 
treasure. officers given the responsibility for that investment 
are carefully selected. There are many times in a twenty-four 
hour day when the captain&rsquo;s training, skill, and judgment are 
fundamental in safely and effectively conducting the carrier&rsquo;s 
mission and successfully reaching the nation&rsquo;s goals. In recognition for his singular role as the commanding officer, the 
crew refers to him simply as &ldquo;the captain.&rdquo; There are several 
other o-6 grade officers on the ship, but there is no ambiguity 
when a crew member refers to &ldquo;the captain.&rdquo; The respect between the captain and his crew is mutual. There are no finer 
examples of our young men and women than those who man 
our carriers. Very young Americans in a stressful and dangerous environment are entrusted with a level of authority 
and accountability that is unique in our society, and their performance always exceeds expectations. If you want to renew 
your faith in our latest generation, visit a deployed carrier and 
observe the crew. </p>
<p>My experience with aircraft carriers goes back to 1976 
on USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV 42), an old Midway-class 
carrier in service since the end of World War II. I was a navy 
lieutenant junior grade, flying the F-4n Phantom on my 
first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea with the Fighter 
Squadron 111 &ldquo;Sundowners.&rdquo; I later transitioned to the F-14 
Tomcat with that squadron and made a second deployment 
on USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) to the Western Pacific and Indian oceans. I made seven more carrier deployments to the 
Mediterranean Sea, north Atlantic, and the Arabian Gulf. 
one of those deployments was with USS America (CV 66), 
supporting the 1986 operation eldorado Canyon strikes in 
Libya. I later served as the executive officer and Commanding officer of Fighter Squadron 142, deploying in 1988 with 
USS Dwight D. eisenhower (CVn 69). In 1991, I deployed 
with USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVn 71) as the Strike Group 
Air operations officer for operation Desert Storm. While 
deployed, I was selected to attend the navy nuclear Power 
School and started what is referred to in the navy as the 
&ldquo;nuclear pipeline,&rdquo; which can ultimately lead to carrier command. From school, now a captain, I was assigned to CVn
71 as the executive officer. We deployed during my tour, but 
this time we went to the Adriatic and supported U.S. efforts 
in Bosnia/Kosovo. After &ldquo;deep draft&rdquo; command of a Fast 
Combat Stores ship, USS Seattle (Aoe 3), I served as the 
Commanding officer of USS George Washington (CVn 73) 
from 1997-2000. We deployed to the Arabian Gulf, supporting U.S. contingency efforts supporting weapons inspections 
in Iraq. My last job in the navy was Commander, Carrier 
Strike Group Four, from 2002-2004. During that tour, my 
job was to train carrier battle groups as they prepared for 
deployment. After the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center 
and the Pentagon, my group trained every east Coast Carrier 
Strike Group that deployed through 2004 in support of operation enduring Freedom.</p>
<p>A convenient way to begin answering the posed question 
might be to start with some background information about 
aircraft carrier captains. They are senior naval aviators with 
about twenty five years of experience in naval aviation communities that operate fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft from 
carriers. The captain&rsquo;s background would include multiple 
deployments on carriers in a variety of leadership positions. 
Prior to selection for carrier command, captains must serve 
as the commanding officer of a carrier-based aircraft squadron, complete navy nuclear Power training, and serve as a 
carrier executive officer. Carrier captains must also command 
a &ldquo;deep draft&rdquo; naval vessel prior to being assigned to command a carrier.</p>
<p>Modern carriers have about five thousand personnel embarked when deployed in a &ldquo;combat-ready&rdquo; status. A flag officer is embarked on the carrier as the Strike Group Commander and is responsible for the overall operations of all 
the ships in the Strike Group. The carrier captain is responsible for providing the platform, aviation assets, and services 
required to support missions assigned by the Strike Group 
Commander. He shares this responsibility with the Carrier 
Air Group (CAG) Commander, who is also a navy captain 
with a similar aviation background. The relationship between 
these two senior aviators is complex and largely beyond the 
scope of the question asked, but basically, the CAG is responsible for leadership of the individual squadrons which make 
up the ship&rsquo;s air wing and for execution of the missions those 
aircraft perform once launched from the carrier. The ship&rsquo;s 
captain is responsible for the condition and safety of the ship 
and for providing most of the material, facilities, and services 
required to prepare the aircraft and pilots for those missions. </p>
<p>The aircraft carrier is frequently described as a small city, 
and the comparison may provide a common perspective for 
discussing the captain&rsquo;s responsibilities. Like the mayor in 
this analogy, the captain provides the leadership and organizational structure necessary to operate the &ldquo;city.&rdquo; The navy&rsquo;s 
modern, 95,000-ton displacement aircraft carrier includes 
about 75 aircraft, a 4.5-acre airfield, catapults and arresting 
gear to launch and recover aircraft, large magazines and storage facilities for ammunition, fuel and aircraft parts, as well 
as high-tech maintenance activities that provide all the services and supplies necessary to keep well-maintained aircraft
ready for mission assignment. For the crew, the carrier provides galleys, berthing areas, laundry services, medical, surgical and dental facilities, and myriad activities necessary to 
ensure the health and well-being of the assigned personnel. 
Like a city, the ship has a fire and emergency response capability and its own security organization, including security 
forces, legal services, brig and a process by which the captain enforces good order and discipline. In addition to aircraft
maintenance, the ship has several other maintenance organizations that keep the ship&rsquo;s propulsion systems, radars, and 
thousands of electronic systems operating. The ship generates 
and distributes its own power, provides and maintains sanitation, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and 
makes several hundred thousand gallons of water every day 
from sea water. This description just summarizes the high-level capabilities of the ship. The next layer includes a variety of 
additional services and activities: radio and television studios, 
machine shops, carpentry shops, automatic teller systems, 
recreation facilities, chapels, libraries, athletic facilities, and 
the list goes on.</p>
<p>The captain leads a cadre of senior naval officers in the 
operation of the ship. These very experienced officers, called 
department heads, lead the various departments providing 
products and services required to complete the ship&rsquo;s mission. 
each of the department heads is an expert in one of the major 
ship departmental functions: Ship operations, Intelligence, 
Propulsion, engineering, Combat Systems, Weapons, Supply, Air operations, Aircraft Maintenance, Safety, Training, 
navigation, Religious Ministries, and Medical. If the Captain 
is the mayor, the ship&rsquo;s executive officer is the city manager. 
With a background similar to the captain&rsquo;s and heir apparent 
for his job, he provides the day-to-day leadership necessary to 
keep all the departments operating efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>As a naval line officer, the commanding officer of a carrier is given broad responsibility for his ship. He is accountable for all aspects of his ship&rsquo;s performance, and that of the 
crew, and is given broad authority commensurate with those 
responsibilities. He is ultimately the final decision authority 
for his command. The concept of a ship&rsquo;s captain having such 
broad responsibilities and ultimate accountability goes back 
to the earliest days of command-at-sea where the ship and 
its crew were largely cut off from any higher authority for 
long periods of time, and the ship&rsquo;s captain was singularly 
charged with the safety and success of his command. Today&rsquo;s 
technology allows a modern carrier to be closely connected 
with higher authority, but the captain&rsquo;s responsibilities for his 
crew, the ship, and the mission have changed little.</p>
<p>Carriers never sleep, and therefore carrier captains seldom do either. Important activities go on throughout the day 
and night. Moving, assembling, and testing ordnance, purifying and storing fuel, organizing the flight deck, mission 
planning, safely navigating the ship, preparing food, training 
and performing maintenance on important ship and aircraft
systems go on around the clock. During flight operations, the 
captain can normally be found on the bridge directly involved 
in the mechanics of positioning and preparing the ship for 
launch and recovery of aircraft, ensuring the safe navigation 
of the ship, and overseeing flight deck operations. Before 
and after flight operations, he will likely be meeting with 
department heads, participating in daily briefings with the 
embarked flag officer and the CAG, and completing numerous administrative responsibilities generated by a command 
as large as the carrier. Flight operations normally consume 
twelve hours per day, and with these additional responsibilities, the captain&rsquo;s day is routinely eighteen to twenty hours 
long; however, numerous special evolutions typically consume 
even more of the captain&rsquo;s time. He is on the bridge for any 
special evolution that presents increased risk to the ship. early morning underway replenishments alongside a fleet oiler, 
navigation of straits or other areas that restrict the carrier&rsquo;s 
ability to maneuver, and entering or leaving ports are all frequently occurring evolutions requiring the captain&rsquo;s presence 
on the bridge. Because of the &ldquo;around the clock&rdquo; nature of 
carrier operations, captains become masters at catching sleep 
whenever they can find a few minutes to do so.</p>
<p>Commanding a carrier is one of the most demanding jobs 
in the navy. on any given day, only eleven officers have these 
responsibilities in the U.S. navy, and in the hundred year history of carrier operations, only a few of many thousands of 
naval aviators have served as carrier commanders. While it 
is a physically demanding job, requiring broad aviation experience, several unique qualifying duty assignments and very 
specialized training, it remains one of the most challenging 
and rewarding jobs in the navy. </p>

<h3>hotels</h3>
<b><h2>How do good hotels always feel so 
clean and fresh?</h2>
Michael Forrest Jones, Beechmont Hotels Corporation</b>
Housekeeping. You may think your own home is nice and 
clean, but even if you're an obsessive-compulsive neat freak, 
hotels play it at an entirely different level. We have to. 
<p>For example, do you change and launder your sheets every 
day? no? But you put fresh sheets on the bed if you're expecting house guests for a few days, on any bed intended for their 
use, right? And you supply them with fresh towels, not one 
you used yourself once already. And even then &mdash; well, when 
was the last time you steamed the carpet in your guestroom, 
or turned the mattress over?</p>
<p>All hotels deal with are house guests. <br/>
You might use one of your own towels at home once, and 
then be okay with saving it for another use the next time you 
take a shower: it is, after all, <i>your towel</i>. You can even use it 
over several days if you want. In a hotel, the next user of the 
towel in your room will be a total stranger. It needs to be so 
clean that you give no thought as you're using it to the fact 
that the <i>last </i>person who used it, unless it's a brand new towel, 
was also a total stranger &mdash; perhaps even someone that you 
wouldn't care to share a towel with. <br/>
Ideally, a hotel will keep three 'turns,' or 'par,' of sheets 
and towels &mdash; that is, enough to make every room in the hotel, three times over &mdash; in inventory (even more if it's a busy 
property with high occupancy). And we're always replacing 
them: any time one has a visible stain that didn't come out in 
the wash, it's retired. (If it's not too bad, we'll cut it up, dye it 
red or blue, and use it as a cleaning rag.) When the available 
supply in a hotel gets down to two and a half turns (again, not 
even that low if it's a busy property, but it's never a good idea 
to let it get any lower than that in any property), it's time to 
order more. During the course of a year, every sheet and towel 
in most hotels will be replaced: in a good hotel, you'll never 
use a sheet or a towel that's more than a year old.<br/>
All linens and terry in a hotel room &mdash; even those that 
do not appear to have been used by the guest &mdash; are replaced 
and laundered when the room is made following check-out, 
and before the next guest arrives. If it's a double room and 
only one bed appears to have been used, the other bed gets 
stripped and changed, too. A really good hotel will even do 
the blankets and bedspreads. Your washer at home would 
probably not tolerate temperature settings that are quite normal for the big ones used in the hotel laundry room, and the 
chemicals are more heavy duty. <br/>
All solid surfaces are squirted down and wiped clean with 
a spray cleaner &mdash; disinfectant as appropriate, something with 
fewer chemicals on surfaces where that will suffice. The bathroom area is mopped, the carpet is vacuumed and sometimes 
treated with a powder for odor control. There's a balancing 
act involved &mdash; fresh means <i>fresh </i>&mdash; so we have to watch it with 
the chemicals, even disinfectants and deodorizers. A disinfectant or excessive perfume smell in a room goes over almost 
as badly as a musty or locker-room smell. You <i>want </i>a hospital 
or clinic to have just a little bit of a disinfectant smell, but 
you shouldn't smell <i>anything</i> in a hotel room when you check 
in, whether good or bad, whether pleasant or unpleasant, 
whether fragrant or stinky, whether indicative of neglect or 
indicative of recent disinfection. <br/>
Smokers will not likely notice a smoke odor left by a previous guest if the room is properly ventilated. non-smokers will 
notice a lingering smoke odor even if it's been days or weeks 
since the room was last smoked in, unless the room has been 
treated with an ozone generator or a fogger chemical to break 
it down. (Sometimes, if a smoker occupied the room for several days, not even that is enough: we have to deep-clean the 
room.) Hence, smoking and non-smoking rooms are separate 
room types and assigned by desk clerks accordingly.<br/>
none other than hotel-issue items should be left in a room 
for the next guest to find. If the coffeemaker has been used, it 
will be switched out with another, clean one, and the old one 
will be taken out for cleaning. We go through the refrigerator, the microwave, and all the drawers and any cupboards, 
removing anything left behind by the last guest and doing any 
cleaning or dusting, as appropriate.<br/>
Underpaid room attendants might take shortcuts, but ideally all this is done every day. In any event, it's like shaving or 
mowing your lawn: even if you miss a spot one time, if you 
do it again promptly the next time it needs doing, chances 
are you'll catch that spot next time; and in the meanwhile, 
you can always hope it's not too noticeable. even so, when an 
expert like Anthony Melchiorri on <i>Hotel Impossible</i> &mdash; given 
the caliber of hotels that he's managed prior to getting his 
own TV show &mdash; over and again suggests always bringing your 
own can of Lysol, and spraying down things in your room 
as soon as you check in, starting with the telephone on the 
nightstand; how much more real can we make it that your 
housekeepers are human like everyone else?<br/>
Additionally, a good housekeeping manager or supervisor 
will add a one or two 'job of the day'-type tasks to the assignment sheets &mdash; things that are easy to not check and to let get 
bad, but on this day, each of the room attendants will check it 
and apply any necessary fix. one day, it will be 'dust the top of 
the picture frames.' Another, it will be 'make sure the Gideon 
Bible and the telephone directory is where it's supposed to be 
in the nightstand, with no marks or damage, check the material on the dresser display, and repair or replace as necessary.' 
The next day, it'll be something else: 'check the iron and make 
sure that it works, and make sure the ironing board cover 
isn't scorched, torn or otherwise in need of replacement,' or 
'check the phone, make sure it works, and go over it with an 
alcohol wipe and beat Anthony Melchiorri to the punch if he 
ever shows up' &mdash; seemingly random things, but all things that 
has to be kept right, and the only way to do it is check them 
ever so often. <br/>
our 'room rack,' our list of available rooms maintained 
at the front desk (in days of old, kept up on an actual metal 
display rack with a pocket for each room and indicator cards 
for each pocket; nowadays, kept up on a computer screen) 
has three settings &mdash; 'dirty,' 'clean,' and 'ready.' A room may 
be clean but not ready: we try to avoid renting it until it is 
cleaned <i>and </i>inspected, gone over by a manager or a person 
other than the room attendant who cleaned it, just to insure 
that nothing was missed.<br/>
every three or four months max (it takes an entire day, 
give or take, with each room so we try to avoid having to do it 
during busy times when we know we can rent all the rooms), 
each room is scheduled for deep-cleaning. Mattresses are 
stripped of all linens and mattress covers, left to air for several hours, then flipped over (front to back in spring and fall, 
end to end in summer and winter) and left to air some more 
before the bed is again made, with a freshly laundered mattress cover in addition to fresh linens and bedspread. While 
that mattress is getting its much deserved rest, furniture is 
removed and cleaned completely, the drapes are taken down 
and laundered, and the carpets are steamed cleaned. Carpet, 
drapes, and furniture in a room should be no more than ten 
years old, and <i>that's</i> pushing it. After five years, we start scrutinizing it more carefully than usual: we might not <i>wait </i>for 
them to get that old before replacing them. Mattresses have 
a life expectancy of maybe five years, even if they are flipped 
regularly.<br/>
How often do you do your own housecleaning &mdash; and replacement of furniture and other articles &mdash; at that intensity? 
not very often, right?<br/>
Then again, it &mdash; or more, if not all of it &mdash; might be doable 
if you had a maid.<br/>
We have several. A good hotel that stays pretty busy will 
have one for every ten to fourteen rooms.</p>

<h3>venture capital</h3>
<b><h2>What is the worst part of being a 
VC?</h2>
Anon User</b><br/>
I have been a VC general partner for nearly ten years at a 
large brand name fund. Have had several successful exits. 
<p>Am on the exact kind of career and portfolio trajectory I 
wanted to be on &mdash; and am extremely thankful for it and wake 
up thanking my lucky stars every morning.</p>
<p>There are
<b> lots of great parts</b> of the job &mdash; especially watching young and small teams create new products, calendar control, and the fact that the pay is pretty good &mdash; even without 
carried interest &mdash; which very few funds in the past decade 
have shown. </p>
<p>The average Silicon Valley partner at a mid-sized to large 
fund ($300+M) on fund three or above makes five hundred 
thousand to two million dollars per year, and the most senior 
partners make four to ten million dollars <b>per year</b>!</p>
So with that in mind, it's really hard to complain about 
any parts of the job when it is really the greatest job on earth.
<p><b>But if forced to pick, the worst parts of the job are:</b>
1. dealing with your partners</p>
<p>At a large fund, there are lots of partners. And what it takes 
to become a partner at a big fund and stay there for years is 
often a high asshole factor, ability and desire to deal with firm 
politics, and internal jockeying for power.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. There are some great great partners. 
But I think two thirds of the people in the GP ranks at big 
firms have massive egos (as one LP put it, "VCs have more 
ego per dollar of return than any asset class we know of").</p>
The way this asshole factor manifests itself is in several 
ways:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Multiple tiers of "partners"</b> - many are partners in name 
only and have no control of the firm's decisions &mdash; see a 
great post here: http://jtangovc.com/vc-economics-andcontrol-unveiled-on-the-web/. never have I more felt like 
a second class citizen than when I (and several other "partners") were not invited to certain meetings around firm 
governance. Also no transparency into the firm's hiring/
firing/financials.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Crazy Back Room Politics</b>: "You vote for my deal at a 
Monday meeting and I will vote for yours" &ndash; this is subtle 
but insidious and leads to mediocre and median returns in 
an industry where the "median" money manager has lost 
money for fifteen years.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Multi-office VC firms</b> often also have a geographic issue 
where decision making becomes all that much harder because partners at the remote offices often feel . . . remote.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Senior partners</b> who are well past medicare age will rarely leave. More often than not, they are forced out &mdash; that 
dynamic lays itself out over and over again. With the egos 
in mind, that is not a surprise.</p>
2. dealing with co-investors.
<p>Take the asshole-factor above and apply it to companies 
where there are often two to four VCs on the board &mdash; each 
with their own agendas and egos &mdash; often not agendas that 
are focused on what is best for the company and often stuck 
around issues like fund reserves, fund life, etc, which most 
GPs will never admit to in a board meeting but <i>absolutely do</i>
impact their perspective.</p>
<p>Also related to the first one, the inability for some "partners" to actually speak on behalf of their partnerships at the 
board level when re-financings and other big decisions happen. </p>
3. it's lonely.
<p>Yes, you have your raft of five to ten companies, Ceos who 
you speak to daily/weekly, boards, portfolio recruiting, partner meetings, etc. But at the core of it, <b>this is an individual 
sport</b>. There's lots of solo travel, solo time at a computer, solo 
meeting taking. If you like true team work &mdash; not the BS of 
VC firm websites &mdash; then VC is not a career for you. Related 
is the answer below about cheering from the sidelines vs. being in the game.</p>
<p>The job of a great VC is to 
<b>be a coach and not a player</b>. 
Many former Ceos who become VCs have trouble with this 
and get stuck in the weeds trying to do the Ceo's job for 
them but taking none of the blame (boy could I tell some 
stories . . . ).</p>
4. the ups and downs
<p>When things aren't going well at the portfolio companies 
(which often tends to happen at the same time), you just feel 
bad about yourself and your ability to pick good teams, companies, etc. You are stuck in these companies for three to ten 
years and the hardest decision to make is to not finance a company's next round due to performance. This rarely happens in 
venture. It should happen more. </p>
<p>I am convinced this is one of the reasons VC has bad returns as an asset class. Sure companies do pivot, but on the 
whole, you know in the first eighteen months if the company 
will be a screaming winner (5x+) or just oK (or worse!).
5. the limited partners</p>
<p>There are some brilliant LPs for sure. But as a whole most 
LPs are bean counters, asset allocators and will always select the shitty Brand Fund raising its seventh fund vs. a great 
emerging manager with a better track record. </p>
<p><b>LPs are the lagging-most indicators in the entire economy.</b> I have had LPs tell me recently that they are really focused on finding new "social media funds" &mdash; really now? After 
so much of the value has been created? LPs are herd thinkers 
extraordinaire. They rarely ask GPs the hard questions like:</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> How do you divide voting and economic control of the 
LLC entity that owns the management company?<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How are junior people compensated? And then isolate junior people to ask them.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
How has the firm done vs public market benchmarks?
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Are the GPs really working or do they take the summer 
off, spring break two weeks off, December off etc? What 
am I buying with my 2.5% fee?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Show me your investment themes for the past year? or 
your investment memos and diligence packs for your biggest three deals.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Lack of creativity with fee and carry structures (ie, lower 
fee, higher carry)
<p>LPs like to "buy IBM" &mdash; that hurts this industry and creates hard conditions for new VCs from existing funds to start 
their own funds. There is no seeder community like there is 
in the hedge world. And so there is very limited job mobility 
in all fact.</p>
6. economics
<p>The salary is great. But then you back out the 1% to 5% that 
GPs have to pay in to the fund and for the younger partners 
making closer to five hundred thousand dollars per year and 
having to pay in their percentage of that GP commit, the economics do start to look markedly worse. I am just seeing my 
first carried interest checks now &mdash; after ten years in the industry! And like I said, this is a brand name very "successful" 
fund.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>
: all of the above are from the perspective of a large, 
multi-sector firm &mdash; with fund sizes over three hundred to five 
hundred million dollars. I'm sure it's very different in a smaller fund with fewer partners.</p>
<p>Finally, notice I did not mention that "
<b>saying no</b>" was a 
hard part of the job &mdash; it's just part of the job &mdash; and that is 
the trite answer you will see a VC give on a panel when asked 
what the hardest part of the job is. But you actually get used 
to that part of it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am very thankful for the job. But there 
are many days where I ask myself why I chose this path and 
daydream about being in a portfolio company as a senior 
exec. The problem is that the longer I stay in VC, the harder 
it is to get out and to do anything more useful.</p>

<h3>airlines</h3>
<b><h2>What are some things that airline 
pilots won't tell you?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p>I'm an airline pilot flying domestically under the banner of a 
major airline. Most people are unaware of how much of their 
flying is done by a "regional" airline. Regional airlines today 
fly a huge percentage of the actual seat miles flown for their 
Major airline partner (Delta, United, US Air, etc.). However 
we are paid a fraction of what the major airline pilots are 
paid, and even these major airline pilots are paid significantly 
less than their counterparts several years ago.</p>
<p>Many regional airline first officers make the same as your 
friendly pizza delivery driver. (It is typical for most of them to 
make no more than sixteen thousand dollars a year the first 
year.)</p>
<p>Here are a few things we won't tell you:<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Don't drink the coffee. The potable water the aircraft is 
serviced with is absolutely disgusting. Chemicals are inserted into the water tanks to prevent bad things from 
growing, but the bad taste of the coffee isn't the coffee &mdash; 
it's  the  chemicals . . .</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 We don't know where we are most of the time . . . (kidding for the most part). In all actuality, there are much 
more sophisticated avionics units on most small general 
aviation aircraft. Those units display many aspects of 
geographic awareness where most of ours simply display 
the route that we programmed in the flight management 
computer before departure. We can tell you how far away 
we are from the next navigation facility and where we are 
in general terms, but aside from that and what we can 
see out the window, we typically only have a general idea 
of where we are when at cruise altitude. of course we all 
carry maps, but not too many of us will open the map 
and follow our progress on a three hour flight. (That all 
changes as we begin descending toward the airport. Situational Awareness is extremely important then.)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 We forget about the fasten seatbelt sign all the time. 
When you look up at the sign (and disregard it typically) 
and it has been illuminated for the last forty five minutes 
in smooth air, we simply forgot. Lots of guys will leave it 
on all the time. However, sometimes we do have reports 
of choppy air ahead and will leave it on until we either 
experience it or take a wild guess that the air ahead will 
be smooth.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Some of us carry guns. This is certainly public knowledge, 
but Federal Flight Deck officers can carry a firearm in the 
cockpit. Lots of protocol exists to ensure that the training, 
concealment, and utilization is standardized.</p>
Those are just a few. Happy flying.<br/>

<h3>recreational drugs</h3>
<b><h2>What's it like to be a drug dealer?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p>In a single word, being a drug dealer was exhilarating. Immense rewards, more than I realized at the time, but also unbelievable stress, unavoidable paranoia, and most difficult of 
all, an existence in a world that does not &ldquo;exist&rdquo; by traditional 
standards.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to what it&rsquo;s like peddling product on the 
street or life as a cartel kingpin. But I can tell you what my 
experience of being a mid-level trafficker was like. My entry 
into trafficking came about suddenly and ended just as quickly, turning those years into blazing memories, grandiose and 
traumatic. It's not easy to put into words and probably best 
said through experience.</p>
<p>Towards the end of my freshman year at a California college, I found out that you could successfully ship weed. But 
that was only part of the puzzle. What made this all possible 
was a friend at a prestigious Ivy League school on the east 
Coast. </p>
<p>We eventually scraped together enough money to buy 
a quarter pound before the end of the school year. Roughly 
twelve hundred dollars at the time, and I sent it to my counterpart. It was enjoyed by a small group of friends and that 
was it. While the profit margin on selling a QP wasn&rsquo;t bad, 
several hundred dollars, it wasn&rsquo;t enough to make clear that 
putting in the work to build the infrastructure could be more 
than worthwhile. It was one of the critical move that led to me 
and this best friend and partner spending the next few years 
of our lives fine-tuning our trafficking craft.</p>
<p>That summer, I spent in new York, where I was working 
for a prominent plaintiffs law firm. Already my third summer of working at a law firm, I was dedicated to going to law 
school and becoming an attorney. But another critical experience put me on the path towards trafficking. While out with 
my friends one night, we were hassled by police after a fight. 
Having weed on my person meant I would be spending the 
night in nY&rsquo;s central lockup. </p>
<p>The only white person booked that night made for a lot 
of conversation. Mostly revolving around the unfortunate circumstances that led to our arrests. But more importantly, the 
discussions over weed prices in various states, sealed in my 
mind an opportunity too good to pass up. </p>
<p>Fast-forward two years; I had made enough connections 
that I was able to secure a &ldquo;front.&rdquo; For those who don&rsquo;t know 
what that means: you give me a pound, I give you the money 
two weeks later. This is how most weed is sold, as small-time 
distributors or beginning traffickers don&rsquo;t usually have the 
cash to pay for product upfront. </p>
<p>While I now had the connection to get product without 
paying upfront, I still had to convince my friend that he could 
sell a pound. At that point, neither of us had any idea. And 
the idea of sending thirty five hundred dollars worth of weed, 
through the mail with no guarantee that it would get there or 
any guarantee that it would sell, was nerve-wracking to say 
the least. But I was young and foolish, eager to make money, 
and willing to take the risk.</p>
<p>With much relief, the pound arrived at our address back 
east, and while it took twice as long to sell as we expected, 
the profit margin was some 35% of the investment, giving us 
a taste of what was to come.</p>
<p>By junior year, my friend and I were basically supplying the entire school with our weed. We were selling three 
pounds a week minimum. But we were starting to exhaust 
our residential mailing addresses and struggling to return 
cash to California in a timely manner. our sales were limited only by our trafficking infrastructure as opposed to our 
capital, because at this point, my connections were happy to 
supply the product.</p>
<p>Sometime around the end of the first semester junior year 
is when we started losing product. We lost our first package, 
a three pack worth roughly twelve grand, which was a substantial hit and easily cut our cash on hand in half. Common 
sense might have told us to quit while ahead. But we (by this 
point) were still willing to take astronomical risks because 
how else can two unemployed colleges students make three 
grand a week? So after letting any heat die down, we went 
back to business.</p>
<p>Coming back to the second semester, we caught two fairly 
large breaks in both intelligence and connections. not only 
did we find a way to pass commercial shipping security tests, 
we secured an &ldquo;in&rdquo; at the Law School mailroom where we 
could send literally any amount of packages, and for the next 
several years, we never lost product to this location.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our Junior year, we had solved a lot of 
our risk issues and had been able to increase our shipments to 
five pounds a week (sometimes more). Saving up enough cash 
so that our prices in California allowed us to make some two 
grand on average per pound.</p>
<p>We were eager to make the rest of the school year count 
and knew that several major events were coming up. This is 
when cocaine came into the picture. Mostly through luck, we 
had stumbled upon an excellent cocaine connection. not only 
was the product top-notch, it was cheap as hell. It was however in Texas, not a convenient location but that didn&rsquo;t stop 
us from packing our bags and driving overnight to Texas to 
buy our first kilo.</p>
<p>That first purchase made for a risky investment, having 
to spend twenty two grand on a kilo of cocaine for only a few 
events we knew were prime for that product. Why risk didn&rsquo;t 
factor into the investment, I&rsquo;m not really sure. We were so 
determined to squeeze every ounce of profit out of this school, 
we lost sight of what reasonable risk, even by drug dealing 
standards, was. We were on a path and there was no turning 
back. once you&rsquo;e in the game, there are no easy exits. </p>
<p>Buying the cocaine turned out to be a huge mistake. one, 
we didn&rsquo;t allow ourselves enough time to build a clientele or 
distribution. And on top of that, it tied up all our capital in 
product, meaning that we went back on front for weed and 
our prices suffered. We had to discount our cocaine just to 
move it before the end of the semester, meaning our investment didn&rsquo;t play out quite as we had expected. Caveat, Ivy 
leaguers buy a lot of coke before finals.</p>
<p>So while my friend, a finance major, for the investment, 
blinded by &ldquo;potential&rdquo; returns, reality played out quite differently. We made a scant profit on a twenty thousand dollar 
investment. Hardly worth the time or risk.</p>
<p>By the end of junior year, we had done well but made some 
critical mistakes. We had established a viable trafficking system but lost considerable product. not a deal breaker, but 
substantial. Money packages had been replaced by expensive 
flights that were taking a toll on my health and academics.</p>
<p>We had built a distribution network and made our connections a lot of money, having moved upwards of a million 
dollars worth of product over the school year. We calculated that over one hundred thousand was spent cumulatively 
through living and business expenses mostly in the form of 
flights, shipping, and prepaid cell phones. But we had lived 
lavishly that year and were able to split some fifty plus grand 
going into the summer. I spent the first month of the summer 
working in a law firm, my last stint in the legal profession 
after some four summers. I spent the next two months in Bali.</p>
<p>When senior year rolled around, I was feeling ambivalent 
but still very committed. But stress was starting to take a toll, 
my grades were shit, and while I wasn&rsquo;t overly paranoid, the 
sight of a cop would make my heart skip a beat. I was twentythree, and my hair was starting to turn grey. </p>
<p>none of those signs caused me to slow down though; our 
business was flowing smoothly, selling the usual five pounds 
a week, sent to the mailroom of course. We were sending a 
few additional pounds to various residential locations and had 
invested in a safe house where we kept cash and product. </p>
<p>We had finally established a distribution network for cocaine, and that quickly started to pay off. The business wasn&rsquo;t 
booming but it was turning more than 50% profit margin. 
But the toll of operating this business was really starting to 
add up. What started as a profitable hobby was turning into a 
full-time profession. </p>
<p>But our business wasn&rsquo;t without problems. We were losing too many of our cash packages, at a tune of ten grand 
apiece. often times almost a week&rsquo;s worth of work. But our 
weed was still getting there no problem, so we moved more 
and more towards flights. My partner, who was a more serious student, was less willing to fly and more willing to lose 
cash, while I was the opposite.</p>
<p>Consequently, I spent a lot of time in the air. I&rsquo;d travel to a 
location, pick up cash, and fly back with forty grand strapped 
to my chest. I had already written off school as a determinant 
for my future and was disillusioned with education through 
my experiences trafficking, convinced in part, that I had a 
future as drug dealer for life. </p>
<p>I was living out of multiple locations around the Bay Area 
and had bought a new car for thirty grand, was spending money on friends and expensive dinners, lavish purchases, and 
non-business related travel. Life was good. So we expanded.</p>
<p>We started selling weed in Texas. The clientele was there, 
the market was there, but building the infrastructure was 
tricky. on a one way flight out of Texas, I was nearly stopped 
by a TSA agent, and then allowed to move forward only because the line was backing up. In retrospect, it was a very 
close call, I had a lot of cash strapped to my chest and legs.</p>
<p>our business at school was going well, and as we moved 
through the second semester, we were poised to leverage any 
possible profits. on one successful weekend, over prominent 
school events, we sold a kilo of cocaine and seven pounds of 
weed. After a few sleepless days, I flew back to California with 
sixty grand on my person. </p>
<p>But as school started to wind down, so did our sales. Concerned about our ability to carry on our successfully operations past graduation, we moved into Texas more and more 
aggressively. our market was unlimited but we were confined 
by our shipping limitations and our Texas connection&rsquo;s cash 
flow.</p>
<p>Luckily our connection in Texas had close ties with cartel 
members whose attention we had caught. They requested that 
we put together a small pack; the only problem, this was outside of our wheelhouse, and we did not have the personnel to 
transport large quantities of weed.</p>
<p>By now, the business was clearly taking a toll on my person. It was clear that I wouldn&rsquo;t be graduating this June, and 
what had started out as general stress had turned into unexpected and full-fledged panic attacks. I had trouble sleeping 
at night and started relying on over the counter sleep medication to rest.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, we did the unthinkable, putting 
together a plan to sell 50 pounds in Texas over spring break. 
The plan was not easy to execute. We had exactly one week 
to make it happen. My partner flew to California with all the 
cash we had "out of state". The plan was to use his parents 
Jeep while they were away for the week to drive to Texas and 
drop off the product then he fly back to school while I would 
then fly to Texas and drive the car and cash back to California. </p>
<p>I greeted my friend at the airport and we went back to 
his house. Collecting our cash and heading up to Humboldt 
where I was meeting our California connection. After many 
hours, driving around looking at our options, we finally settled on product and spent two hours vacuum sealing the weed 
so that I could drive it back to the Bay Area. I left just before 
dark, for a seven hour drive after eating just an apple for the 
day.</p>
<p>I was unbelievably nervous. I had never driven that much 
weed before and the only way from Humboldt to the Bay Area 
is through a stretch of road called the Gauntlet which should 
speak for itself. I had one spotter driving in front, and another behind me. The hours passed slowly as I weaved through 
traffic in the dark, often losing my spotter and trailing car. 
I left my partner&rsquo;s house at seven that morning and finally 
returned at one in the morning the next day. But this was 
just the beginning. I spent the rest of the night and the next 
morning vacuum sealing the product and packing the car. 
Then my friend left for Texas.</p>
<p>A few nerve-wracking days later, he arrived at the location, where things got off to a bumpy start. our connection 
lost a small amount of product in an unfortunate robbery situation, but the cartel purchased the rest of our product for just 
over two hundred grand. We were more than half way there. I 
arrived the next night in Texas at midnight. My friend picked 
me up at the airport, and we went back to a location outside 
of Houston. For the first time in my life, I held nearly a quarter million dollars in cash. A triumph to say the least: I was 
twenty three years old.</p>
<p>I left at four that morning without sleeping. There was not 
a single car on the road. Then out of nowhere, a car starts trailing me. Seconds later, lights flash and that car is pulled over. 
I can only assume that the cop pulling over the only other car 
on the road, in Texas, in the middle of the night, was coming 
for my car with California license plates. Without an option, I 
pushed on rattled, knowing that I very well might have made 
one of the worse decisions of my life. I drove from Houston to 
the Bay Area in twenty seven hours. Stopping only to nap for 
an hour at a time, so exhausted and sleep deprived that when 
I would awake from a nap, it would take what seemed like 
an eternity to figure out where I was and what I was doing. 
Thinking about it still makes me nauseous to this day.</p>
<p>How did I get here? What was I doing? I do not know. The 
gravity of the situations I found myself in, the effort that went 
into planning our deals, was beyond anything I could have 
ever imagined. My partner and I found ourselves only a few 
deals away from supplying a major cartel with quality weed 
from California. There was some talk of turning back, some 
reflection into our futures, and then the determination that 
you don&rsquo;t come this far just to quit. once you&rsquo;re in the game, 
there is no letting go, there are no easy exits.</p>
<p>I arrived in California much relieved and with two shoeboxes full of cash, stashed safely in my parents house. our 
business with the school had more or less ended, or wasn&rsquo;t 
worth the effort, and we settled in for a brief vacation. But 
we were poised to take over. We had a brief window of time 
before our California connection was leaving the country for 
several months. Anxious not to let the prospect die, we orchestrated an even bigger transaction, some hundred and fifty 
pounds for over half a million dollars.</p>
<p>But things had changed considerably, having survived our 
Texas trip, my friend and I refused to make the journey, arguing that as the main connections between California and 
Texas, we were too important to be transporting the product. 
Fortunately, our California connections were able to secure 
transport at a hefty but reasonable rate. It was getting late in 
the season and prices were less than favorable. But we were 
able to source product that made the deal worthwhile. And 
after investing two hundred grand of our hard earned money, 
the pack left California.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the border of Mexico, our driver 
was pulled over. Brandishing a California driver license in a 
car with Texas plates, he never stood a chance and is still serving time. My only regret is that we were confident enough to 
put everything we had into the deal. You might say our luck 
had run out, and after getting one of the worst calls of my life, 
the deal was canceled. I was broke. </p>
<p>My trafficking business ended just as quickly as it started. everything we had worked for over the past two years 
vanished suddenly. I was lost and scared. Having completely 
abandoned interest in a professional career or a real job, my 
resume hadn&rsquo;t been updated in two years. I was basically unemployable as we headed into a severe financial crisis.</p>
<p>I tried momentarily to rebuild our business, but was exhausted and emotionally depleted. It was more difficult for 
me to accept the finality of this situation than my friend, who 
was more apt for the professional world with good grades and 
a masters in finance. He had also been receiving considerable 
allowance from his parents while we had both been living off
drug money, saving considerably over the past two years.</p>
<p>The next year, I claimed only five thousand dollars worth 
of income. But at the very least, I had bought enough toys 
to keep myself entertained, and I still had my car, for which 
I struggled to make the final payments, while I lived at my 
parent&rsquo;s house. out of desperation, I confessed to my parents 
who somehow, had no idea. </p>
<p>What I found remarkable is what we were able to build 
through hard work and determination. What&rsquo;s it like to be a 
drug dealer? It means the things you see, people you encounter, and the life you lead have little foundation in reality. The 
risks are immense and the rewards, even greater.</p>
<p>We had reached a point, where we couldn&rsquo;t turn back and 
to this day, I don&rsquo;t know whether it was about the money or 
if it was the rush. After the first Texas trip, I realized that it 
wasn&rsquo;t just about money, drug dealing is gambling with your 
life, a most sadistic rush.</p>
<p>But selling drugs was the best preparation I could have 
asked for, entering the real world. now equipped to handle 
situations that it takes others years to prepare for. More than 
anything, selling drugs taught me to believe in myself and 
what I&rsquo;m capable of. It taught me to trust my instincts and 
how to make difficult decisions.</p>
<p>I was the kid in high school that teachers and good students wrote off. But looking back, even with my stint as a 
drug dealer, few people in my past can compare successes to 
that which I have experienced. of course, with that success 
came immense failure for better or for worse. And the toll it 
took on my health and psyche probably wasn&rsquo;t worth it. But 
had it not been for those experiences, I wouldn&rsquo;t be where 
I&rsquo;m at now. </p>
<p>After some time, I was fortunate enough to land an excellent position at a startup in LA that suits my personality perfectly. My friend and I reminisce fondly, wondering what life 
would have been like had that one deal gone through.</p>

<h2>SCIenCe</h2>
<h3>insects</h3>
<b><h2>If you injure a bug, should you kill 
it or let it live and not die?</h2>
Matan Shelomi, Entomologist</b>
<p>As far as entomologists are concerned, insects do not have 
pain receptors the way vertebrates do. They don't feel "pain," 
but may feel irritation and probably can sense if they are damaged. even so, they certainly cannot suffer because they don't 
have emotions. If you heavily injure an insect, it will most 
likely die soon: either immediately because it will be unable 
to escape a predator, or slowly from infection or starvation. 
Ultimately this crippling will be more of an inconvenience 
to the insect than a torturous existence, so it has no "misery" 
to be put out of, but also no real purpose anymore. If it can't 
breed anymore, it has no reason to live. </p>
<p>In other words, I have not answered your question because, as far as the science is concerned, neither the insect 
nor the world will really care either way. Personally, though, 
I'd avoid doing more damage than you've already done. 1) 
Maybe the insect will recover, depending on how damaged it 
is. 2) Some faiths do forbid taking animal lives, so why go out 
of your way to kill? 3) You'll stain your shoe.</p>

<h3>Black widow</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to be bitten 
by a black widow spider?</h2>
Brad Porteus, She bit me.</b>
<p>It was a sunny Sunday morning in the summertime of 2006 
in Redwood City, California, and the Mrs. was back east with 
her gal pals for a weekend of recharging her batteries and 
reconnecting with old friends.</p>
<p>I was holding down the fort with the munchkins (boys, 
four and one and three quarters), and in the interest of creating a morning diversion, we began to make preparations for 
a walk in the local hills. Sunscreen on, snacks loaded, water 
filled, stroller out &mdash; you know the drill.</p>
<p>I grabbed a pair of old shoes from the garage, and hastily 
threw them on over my bare feet, and continued my charge 
around the house to build momentum to get out the door. 
About a minute later, I realized that there was some wiggling 
in the toes of my right shoe, and just as I was about to take 
my shoe off, I felt a ***** on my second toe &mdash; not painful, but 
a bit annoying.</p>
<p>I took my shoe off on the outside steps, and dumped it 
out, discovering a jet black inky spider with a body the size of 
an engorged pea. I instructed my son to grab his bug-catcher, 
which was conveniently nearby, and I dumped the spider into 
the clear container for inspection.</p>
<p>Imagine my horror when I rotated the container and got 
a glimpse of a distinct reddish/brown hourglass figure on the 
belly of the black black spider. oK, I reasoned, I'd lived in 
those parts for the better part of nearly four decades, and I'd 
neVeR heard of anyone seeing (let alone getting bitten by) 
a black widow spider, so presumably this is just a copy-cat 
spider that is harmless.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose before heading out for a walk, I ought to 
be safe and call the urgent care and see what they think. <br/>
After being reassured that there was "no way" I had been 
bitten by a black widow, the attending physician confessed 
that she was looking at information on Google (!!!) and started to ask me questions about what it looked like.<br/>
After twenty minutes on the phone (with the boys starting 
to melt down), and getting on the Internet myself, I began to 
experience my first tell-tale symptom &mdash; a slight cramping in 
my lower right leg.<br/>
At this point, the doctor changed position entirely, and 
strongly recommended that I get medical attention immediately.<br/>
oK, kids, time to pile into the wagon. We're heading to 
the eR.<br/>
Ten minutes later, I walked through the doors at the eR 
at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, CA, with holding the 
hands of my two boys, along with the bug catcher.<br/>
"Thirty minutes ago, THIS spider, bit me on THIS toe, 
and now THIS leg is cramping."<br/>
The otherwise bored doctors and nurses who were 
numbed by their predictable flow of blunt trauma, heart palpitations, and other mundane dramas rapidly appeared out 
of the woodworks and collectively shouted a big "Yah!!!" This, 
they thought, was soooo cool.<br/>
note: Capturing and bringing in the actual spider was by 
far the smartest thing I did all day, as it brought me instant 
celebrity and credibility, as the bite itself was completely and 
somewhat disappointingly unremarkable.<br/>
It was delicately but firmly suggested that I make some 
phone calls and line up some child-care, as soon I'd be all 
jacked up full of morphine and other things that would make 
me a less-than effective father.<br/>
I was able to get a hold of my neighbor friends, who gamely dropped what they were doing, and came to pick up my 
boys. We had a long discussion about how to orchestrate the 
movement of cars and carseats, including me driving their 
car home, which was completely naive given how F-d up I was 
about to become.<br/>
By now the cramping had migrated into my groin area, 
and I was beginning to wonder what was in store. I was told 
that an anti-venom does indeed exist, but it's kept in Arizona, 
and is highly toxic in and of itself, so they don't fly that in unless I was otherwise at risk (toddler, elderly, poor immune system). So, my fate was to get jacked up on opiates and survive 
the onslaught of the neurotoxin from the spider that would 
otherwise cause tremendous pain and cramping for the next 
six hours.<br/>
At this point, I texted (SMS) my wife (who was on her 
way to the airport to come home from Boston): "Hey there. 
I'm in the eR. Got bitten by a black widow. Love ya." So much 
for a relaxing end to her fun getaway.<br/>
Several hours of mental bliss later, I was discharged from 
the eR, and picked up by my Dad, who took me to the pharmacy to pick up my meds (vicodin for pain, muscle relaxants). 
I was slurring words, and otherwise out of it, and happy to 
get home to relax.<br/>
The next forty-eight hours were literally a blur. I barely remember any of that time, and mentally, lost track of days and 
hours. It freaked my wife out when I said I thought my Mom 
had spent the night, so I guess I was hallucinating.<br/>
We assumed at the time, that the meds were the culprit, 
but now later, we're pretty sure the delirium was a byproduct 
of the neurotoxins.<br/>
The medical literature suggests that recovery happens 
within three to five days. nights three and four and five were 
complete disasters for me. For some completely unknown reason, I was sweating profusely at night. As in, literally soaking 
through my sheets and changing my sheets three times on one 
night and twice the next. Wet, not damp.<br/>
Specifically, I was leaking sweat out of my legs. I'd wipe 
them off, and they'd bead up immediately. It was freaky, to say 
the least.<br/>
Also, I was having trouble concentrating, or being coherent for up to five days. Sleep was next to impossible, and I 
was getting worn down. I later learned my wife was doing her 
own Google searches to see what the risks were of permanent 
brain damage. And, I think my life insurance was promptly 
renewed shortly thereafter.<br/>
The doctors switched me over from vicodin to valium (one 
makes the pain go away, one makes you not care about the 
pain). Finally, I got a decent night sleep on Thursday, and a 
good one on Friday. I awoke on Saturday morning (day six) 
feeling like a human being for the first time, and proceeded 
to clean the garage like a freakin' maniac.<br/>
Upon further inspection of my shoe in question, I discovered that the spider was harboring an egg sac inside my shoe. 
How rude of me to put my foot in there. She was actually 
quite restrained in waiting so long to bite me, and it turns out 
that these deadly creatures are incredibly passive. This is why 
it's so rare that a bite happens, as in fact, I discovered, these 
spiders are everywhere in the area where I was living.<br/>
If this happens to you, hang in there, and ride it out. You 
will get better, but it takes some time.<br/>
When I returned to work, my co-workers had decorated 
my cubicle with all sorts of Spiderman memorabilia and delighted in my misery. All in good fun.</p>

<h3>spiders</h3>
<b><h2>How does a spider decide where to 
put up its web?</h2>
Marc Srour, Invertebrate palaeontologist, arthropod systematist, historian of biology. </b>
<p>The most important factor is 
<b>phylogeny</b>. each spider family 
has its own characteristic arrangement of spinnerets (the organs used to spin the webs), and they decide what type of web 
can be built. And this shape is adapted to one specific type of 
habitat. Here's a small, general guide (exceptions abound, as 
usual):</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Mygalomorphs</i> (e.g., trapdoor spiders): most can only construct simple lines of silk, which can act as detectors. They 
live in burrows, with these sensory silk lines radiating out 
of them. When the lines are cut, the spider knows that 
prey is nearby and comes out and ambushes it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i> Sheet-web builders</i> (e.g., velvet spiders, funnel-web spiders): As the name says, their silk comes out in massive 
sheets. And the best place to put a sheet is, of course, on 
some vegetation under a tree, with insects dropping from 
the tree being a good source of food. Funnel web builders 
have a bit more control over their webs, being able to connect a circular ("funnel shaped") burrow made out of silk 
in which the spider lives.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i> Space-web builders</i> (e.g., linyphiids, theridiids): These 
webs take up space. Linyphiid ones consist of a bowl made 
out of tangled threads, and attached to the lower branches 
of a tree. That way, anything falling from either the lower 
branches or the canopy will come into the bowl, and the 
spider (which stays on the underside the bowl) will just 
collect all the food easily. Theridiids (which are actually 
highly-derived orb weavers that build space webs, so I put 
them here) have slightly more refined webs, since they 
have specific combs on their legs allowing them to craft
the silk into neat lines instead of a densely-packed bowl. 
To make up for the lack of catchment though, their silk is 
very sticky (like all orb-weavers) and they can also throw 
silk at their prey (kinda like Spiderman).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<i>Orb weavers</i> have the most control over their webs. They're 
the typical meticulous geometric ones (they have their 
own classification, including radial webs and spiral webs, 
etc.). They're very finely-tuned to be as good as possible at 
catching prey. They show asymmetries depending on the 
specific tree/bit of vegetation they're at, so that each line 
is in the path of a flying insect; the spider will also use 
light cues and a gravity compass to make sure their web 
is in the best possible position. (The role of experience vs. 
genetic predisposition would make a cool study, if it hasn't 
been  studied  already . . . )</p>

<h3>higgs Boson discovery</h3>
<b><h2>If I want to look smart, what do 
I need to know about the Higgs 
Boson discovery?</h2>
Jay Wacker, Faculty at Stanford/SLAC in theoretical physics.</b><br/>
You can take a few stories from the following list:<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Higgs is a fundamentally new type of elementary particle that we have never seen before.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Up until now, all particles have been fermions (spin 1/2 
particles like the electron) or vectors (spin 1 particles like 
the photon).</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Higgs boson is a spin 0 particle.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
This is the first elementary particle to be discovered since 
the tau neutrino in 2001. However, there was significantly less excitement about this particle, because it was the 
third neutrino, and we knew it had to be there (it wasn't a 
new type of particle).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The last particle people got fairly excited about was the 
top quark, which happened in 1994, but again we sort 
of knew it had to be there. The top quark is the heaviest 
known elementary particle, so there was reason for some 
excitement. And the LHC is still discovering properties 
about the top quark.  The real parallel was the discovery of 
the W and Z vector bosons, which was in 1983 at CeRn. 
These were massive vector bosons, and we'd never seen 
them before. They'd been hypothesized by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam in the 1960s.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
It has been 30 years since the discovery of a particle of this 
magnitude.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Higgs boson isn't just a random particle. The Higgs 
boson is the excitation of a "field" (like the photon is the 
excitation of the electric and magnetic field).<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Higgs field does something strange: throughout the 
entire Universe, it takes on a uniform, non-zero value.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
When the Higgs field does this, the interactions between 
the Higgs boson and other particles acquire their mass.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> If the Higgs field didn't do this, all particles would be 
massless (some small technicalities that I'm glossing over).
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Standard Model of Particle Physics describes all the 
known properties of nature (with the exception of dark 
matter).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
To know how the Higgs boson behaves, you have to know 
the Higgs boson mass (i.e. the mass is not a prediction of 
the theory).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The only thing you have to specify is the mass of the Higgs 
boson, after that, all interactions of the Standard Model 
are fixed, and you can make predictions to arbitrary accuracy (though it is very hard practically).</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Therefore, the searches for the Higgs boson always left the 
mass as a free parameter.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Before July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson mass could only be in 
the 122 GeV to 130 GeV mass range (units where the proton mass is about 1 GeV, and the W and Z vector bosons 
are 80 GeV and 90 GeV, respectively).  There was a small 
excess from the December 2011 results at 125 GeV. Many 
people suspected that the excess was the Higgs boson.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
on July 4, 2012, the experiments showed that this excess 
grew substantially with the additional data that was recorded in 2012.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
each experiment reached the "5 sigma" discovery threshold, which means that if there wasn't something there, 
it would be a fluke that would occur 1 time in 3,000,000 
chances.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 There are two general purpose experimental collaborations at the LHC, each of which has 3000 physicists working. They are called ATLAS and CMS.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Both experiments saw the same Higgs mass (a small difference the masses), meaning that the chance that this is 
fluctuation is roughly 1 in 3,000,000^2 (very bad statistics, 
here) Whether this excess is the Higgs boson will take 
more time because many of the predictions of the Standard Model need to be checked (remember there is no 
freedom to change predictions around once the mass is 
known).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The rough properties of this particle agree with the Standard Model prediction, but there is roughly 50% uncertainty in all the measurements of the largest couplings.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
If this wasn't the Higgs boson, the couplings could have 
been different by a factor of 100 or more, so the fact that 
they agree to 50% is already telling.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
If the properties don't exactly agree with the predictions, 
it means that the Standard Model is incomplete.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
This doesn't mean that it isn't the Higgs boson, but more 
likely, the Standard Model is incomplete, and there are 
new particles and interactions for the Higgs boson that 
are changing the precise properties (but leaving the gross 
features intact).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The LHC will accumulate at least 3 times as much data 
over the next 5 or 6 months, meaning that you'd guess 
that the properties of the Higgs boson will be known better by about 40%.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
There are many theoretical physicists who are associated 
with the Higgs boson.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Most notably Peter Higgs, but also Francois englert and 
Robert Brout (recently deceased).
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Additionally, there was a seminal paper by Tom Kibble, 
Gerry Guralnik, and Carl Hagen. There was earlier important work by Julian Schwinger, Philip Anderson, and 
Yoichiro nambu (all previous nobel Prize winners).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 The distinguishing feature of Peter Higgs' work is that 
he focused on the Higgs boson and not the Higgs mechanism (which is the process that causes particles to acquire 
mass).</p>
Hopefully this will get you through a cocktail party.

<h3>the universe</h3>
<b><h2>How has our understanding of the 
universe changed in the last 100 
years?</h2>
Alia Caldwell, submerged in spring rain</b><br/>
in 1912
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Physics is unified. Physicists reasonably assume that we 
are approaching a wrapping-up of physical knowledge 
about the Universe, with just a few 't's to cross and 'i's to 
dot for future generations to worry about.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The laws of Thermodynamics are understood, fleshed out 
by Planck, Maxwell, Boltzmann, Gibbs, et al.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> electromagnetic theory is also established by Maxwell, 
Gauss, Faraday, etc.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Light is properly described by wave theory.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Rutherford has established the notion of radioactive halflife and has created a useful model of an atom with a nucleus (though he has yet to split that atom). </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 einstein has presented his paper on Special Relativity 
(1905), which threw a cat among the pigeons by predicting matter-energy equivalence and unifying space and 
time, an audacious development on sacred newton. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
In 1912 also, Vesto Slipher measures the first Doppler redshift to undermine the conventional view, but to science, 
the Universe is still in an eternal static state. (Later on, in 
a particularly delicious irony, the Big Bang Theory is first 
proposed by a Roman Catholic Priest, Georges Lema&icirc;tre 
(1927)).</p>
in 2012
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Physics has bifurcated into Astrophysics and Quantum 
Mechanics. Attempts to reunite them invoke multidimensional acrobatics like String Theory and Loop Quantum 
Gravity. We still wait to see if these two branches can actually be reunified by a provable esoteric uber-theory.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 The Universe is expanding from a Big Bang creation 
event 13.75 billion years ago. We are shuffling around the 
cooling detritus of this creation.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Quantum Mechanics supplies us with a new physics that 
departs from classical physics at the subatomic level. It 
describes the interactions of energy and matter in counterintuitive ways. The two major interpretations of QM 
are equally absurd (yet strangely beautiful) &mdash; Copenhagen and Many Worlds Theory. Whichever, we are superimposed.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> Light and other particles have a dual particle/wave nature.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Most of the Universe is now composed of unknown stuff: 
Dark energy and Dark Matter, leaving just 4 percent 
over as stuff we have the vaguest clue about or tangible 
theories for.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Universe is a pretty scary place, filled with monsters 
and titans: Black Holes, Quasars, Gamma-Ray Bursters. 
our maps again carry an inscription around the edges: 
<i>There be dragons</i>.</p>

<h3>animal Behavior</h3>
<b><h2>Would a lone adult wolf be able 
to take down an athletic adult 
human?</h2>
Oliver Starr, Studied ethology at CU Boulder</b>
<p>Let me stress that the chances of a healthy, wild wolf attacking a person are next to nil. This simply doesn't happen as 
wolves are very timid and are extremely fearful of people. 
That  said . . .</p>
<p>Having survived a serious attack from a wolf that I cared 
for, I can tell you from personal experience that at best survival is probably a 75/25 proposition.</p>
<p>These animals are far stronger and far faster then you 
can possibly imagine. even someone intimately familiar with 
wolves is at risk. First consider this, then I'll relate my own 
story for those that care to do the reading. There are plenty of accounts of individual wolves pulling down full grown 
elk. If you think a person could do that without some sort of 
weapon, you haven't spent enough time in the woods. There 
are even a few instances where individual wolves have taken a 
moose. This is almost impossible to imagine. The average bull 
elk weighs 550 pounds, a moose, up to 1400.</p>
<p>now for my own experience. Incidentally I weigh about 
180 pounds and have had a long career as an athlete. At the 
time of the attack, I was in excellent physical condition and 
was definitely much stronger than an average person of similar size since my job was to train. Please note this is pulled 
straight from my notes/diary at the time of the incident. Apologies that it reads a bit like a story &mdash; the facts and nature of 
the injuries should be clear enough.</p>
<p><i>It was ten below zero the day of the attack, and I was 
dressed for the weather. Good thing, too. Otherwise I might 
have lost my arms &mdash; literally.</i></p>
<p><i>Wolves only mate once a year, and when they're in season, 
they're uppity. I wouldn't make the same mistake today.<br/>
We'd been out in the forest shooting some pictures for a 
wildlife magazine when we realized we'd lost the sun and needed to get off the mountain.<br/>
I'd already put a leash on Jake, who was a male that 
weighed roughly a hundred and twenty pounds. I'd been fostering him for about six months, but since he was an animal I 
hadn't raised myself, our relationship was a somewhat uneasy 
one. He clearly regarded me with a certain amount of suspicion.<br/>
His enclosure-mate, Jessa, (a spayed female) was still offlead, and as we approached the road, I grew nervous that she 
might run ahead of us and onto the small mountain highway 
where we had parked our truck. Each time she'd run by us, I 
would try to grab her and miss, and with each attempt she 
thought the game was more interesting. She' d been with me 
her whole life &mdash; I'd literally helped deliver her &mdash; so I thought 
nothing of lunging for her as she shot past.<br/>
The problem was that Jake didn't think this was a game 
at all, and I was so focused on getting control of Jessa that I 
hadn't noticed how agitated he was growing with my attempts 
to capture his mate. Attempts I now realize he interpreted as 
aggression.<br/>
As Jessa shot by again, I pounced, grabbing a hold of her 
scruff so I could get her on a lead. As I did so, Jake attacked.<br/>
As luck would have it, he seized my arm that was nearer 
his face in what I immediately realized was an all-out attack.<br/>
Having been around wolves for about ten years at that 
point, I knew the last thing I wanted was to be in a tug of war 
with a wolf where my arm was the rope.<br/>
With my free arm I grabbed his head and threw my self on 
top of him, hoping that by rolling him to the ground, I could 
regain control of the situation.<br/>
The next forty-five seconds seemed like an eternity. It felt like 
I was in three places at once. I could hear my assistant screaming, I could feel the incredible pain of the bones in my forearm 
being crushed by Jake's jaws, and at the same time, there was 
a part of my conscious that was completely detached observing 
the situation with the cool analytical mind of a scientist.<br/>
I distinctly remember this scientist's mind thinking, "He's 
much, much stronger than I expected. The pressure is incredible."<br/>
Meanwhile back inside my body, I was in the fight of my 
life. I'd shoved my free hand into Jake's mouth to prevent him 
from fully cleaving my arm in two. Even with my fully gloved 
hand in his mouth, I could feel things inside my arm crackling 
and popping as muscle, tendon, and bone began to give way.<br/>
As this was happening, I recalled a time when, as a child, 
my younger brother had managed to get the front of an oversized Wellington stuck between the treads of an escalator near 
the top of the flight. And like the escalator, Jake's mouth was 
relentless, merciless, efficient.<br/>
My brother was fortunate. The powerful machine sliced the 
front of the boot clean off, leaving his foot intact. I wasn't going 
to be so lucky.<br/>
The scientist's mind was already calculating how long I 
could last if I lost the arm so far from help.<br/>
Thankfully, I didn't need to find out. My assistant, a feisty 
calf-roper I called Frankie had been around animals all her 
life, and she did what she later claimed any ranch chick would 
do; she grabbed Jake by the balls and yanked hard.<br/>
Suddenly the pressure was gone. I leaped to my feet and 
Frankie lunged for the lead in an effort to get Jake under control.<br/>
She got hold of the rope but not before Jake hurled himself 
towards me going for my exposed throat. Thanks to Frankie, 
he came up just short, his teeth finding purchase in the bicep 
of my left arm. Even with all the layers of winter clothes, the 
damage was instant and severe. I immediately lost all feeling 
in my hand.<br/>
Fortunately for us, Jake's aggression was only directed towards me, and Frankie was able to pull him away and tie his 
leash to a nearby Aspen tree.<br/>
"Listen to me carefully," I said. "I'm not sure how badly I'm 
hurt, and I'm not going to try and find out now. I need to get 
myself off this mountain, and I need you to get the animals."<br/>
"First catch Jessa and leash her. Give me a five minute head 
start so we don't have any more issues with Jake. I'll either be in 
the truck or in the trail."<br/>
"No," Frankie said. "I'm going to go home get a gun and 
shoot Jake, he's too dangerous."<br/>
"You don't get it," I said. "It's ten below, we're two miles from 
the car and an hour from a hospital. I'm bleeding. I know my 
forearm is broken, and I can't feel my hands. I don't have time 
for an argument. Just do what I told you."<br/>
I didn't wait for an answer. I was already getting very cold, 
and the lurking scientist in the back of my mind was coolly 
informing me I had about twenty minutes to get somewhere 
warm.<br/>
My recollection of the hike off the mountain is hazy. I felt 
like I was a robot programmed to keep walking. Clutching both 
arms to my chest, my balance was poor, and I stumbled and fell 
more times than I can remember. Somehow struggling back to 
my feet each time. Finally, I could see the black ribbon of icy 
asphalt below and for the first time since the attack I started to 
believe I might actually survive the ordeal.<br/>
At the hospital, I claimed I'd injured myself cutting firewood. They didn't believe me, but it didn't matter, the job was 
the same.<br/>
They cut my clothing off my arms and my gloves from my 
hands. There was surprisingly little blood externally, but beneath the surface of the skin it was another story. My right 
forearm had been nearly pulverized. The pressure of the bite 
had broken both bones in multiple places, the muscle sheathes 
were ruptured, and numerous tendons had been severed from 
the bite.<br/>
My right hand was also broken, apparently from my efforts 
to save my arm by stuffing my hand in Jake's mouth as we 
rolled on the ground. His final effort to get to my throat resulted 
in an eighty percent tear of my left bicep.<br/>
Initially the doctors weren't sure they'd be able to save my 
left hand, so extensive was the internal damage to the bone and 
tissue higher up, in my forearm.<br/>
Fortunately some of the world's best hand surgeons were a 
few hours up the road at the Steadman Hawkins clinic in Vail.<br/>
Unlike the doctors at the ER near my home, I gave them 
the full story. I felt they needed to understand the true nature of 
the injury if they were going to be able to treat it.<br/>
This turned out to be a stroke of luck. It's not every day a 
doctor gets to see the damage imparted by a wolf on the human 
body</i> . . .<br/>
Ultimately, the doctors were able to mend the bone, repair the ligaments, and reattach the tendons and I mostly 
healed. My left bicep still has a large chunk missing where 
the muscle never healed, and it's about 20% weaker than my 
right one. My right forearm still has bulges where the muscle 
sheath was ruptured and has never fully healed. I have normal 
strength in both hands, but chronic pain in the forearm that 
was broken.<br/>
In summary, without having someone with me, I am certain the animal would have killed me, and I had the advantage 
of knowing the animal and knowing about these animals. I'm 
pretty sure that an individual without these advantages stands 
little chance of surviving an all out attack.<br/>
I want to stress again that it is very important to keep in 
mind that wolves are generally fearful of people, and for this 
reason the chances of such an attack are near zero. In fact, I 
don't believe that wolves living freely that have not been habituated to people in at least some minimal way would attack 
an adult human unless the animal was sick or given no other 
option (for example if one was intentionally cornered).</p>

<h3>mind hacks</h3>
<b><h2>Does bouncing your leg improve 
cognition?</h2>
Nan Waldman, The education of children, people, and families is my calling.</b>
<p>If you accept as evidence the testimony of someone who has 
worked as a 1:1 tutor, education consultant, and parent counsel for the past twenty plus years, the short answer is a qualified 'yes'. </p>
<p>The long answer:<br/>
When reading about MRIs of students with ADHD, I 
realized that the more they moved, the more areas of their 
brains 'lit up' with activity. This was particularly true of upper arm movement, which was rhythmic. I got an idea . . . and 
first implemented it experimentally years ago, while working 
as a reading specialist with students who have learning disabilities.<br/>
Parents of children who are not succeeding in school usually try "everything" they know of to help their children to 
learn. By the time they find me, their children are burned out 
by teachers and school, have low self-esteem, are two or more 
grade levels behind their peers in reading and/or math, have 
deficits in vocabulary and spelling, and are generally totally 
turned off, and/or are noted by school teachers to be behavior 
"problems." They come to me because their parents drag them 
to 'try once more.' And they're not happy.<br/>
<b>What I notice is this: they want to move</b>. They are not allowed to move in class. They are supposed to 'sit still' and 'be 
quiet' until it is 'their turn to talk.' And I also notice they are 
not usually very confident or physically fit (or they are very fit 
and can't stop fidgeting) &mdash; one or the other. <br/>
So I tell them that they are in control of their bodies and 
that I am going to move with them. I give them something to 
squeeze (a nerf ball or squish ball of some sort). I give them 
a peppermint (so they can suck on it). I do whatever it takes 
to engage their senses and energy so they can focus on text. 
They hold one side of the book, I hold the other. They move 
left, I move left.<br/>
<b>Examples:</b></p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
A student I just taught this summer could not read unless 
we were lying on the floor on our stomachs with the book 
in front of us &mdash; and he was kicking both of his legs knee 
to ankle up and down, rhythmically. Thump! one foot hit 
the floor. It came back up and thump! The other foot hit 
the floor.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Another kid leaned back in our tilt-and-turn rocking 
chairs, put his feet on the desk (above his head), and 
rocked back and forth, upside down, while holding his 
side of the book as I held mine, rocking in tandem beside 
him. </p>
<p>Both of these kids made astounding progress.
<i> I think it was 
because they had the freedom to move as they needed to, as 
they were learning.</i></p>
<p><i>Bouncing your leg rhythmically improves cognition if it 
keeps you focused on your material instead of wishing you could 
be elsewhere, moving in another way, and therefore distracting 
you from your text. Your focus on your text and processing that 
text contribute to improved cognition. Whatever helps &mdash; do it.</i></p>
<p>If you want to improve your cognition, start jumping rope. 
Aim to improve the number of times you skip rope without 
tripping the rope &mdash; and improve by at least one count every 
day. Keep a chart. You will see that as your jumprope ability increases, your cognitive ability will also increase. I don't 
know if it is a 1:1 correlation, or even a causation. I do know 
there is some correlation because I have seen it in every one 
of my students.</p>
<p>Bouncing your leg is a small way to improve focus, which 
improves cognition. But to really do it right, also have a jumprope handy and use it during every break in studying or 
working . . .</p>
<p>Matt Hastie adds an important link in his comment to 
this answer, and I am taking the liberty of quoting from him, 
here: </p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>So why do kids with ADHD fidget and wiggle and run and jump 
and bounce and scream and play so much? Kids with ADHD 
are understimulated, which means that their thresholds are so 
high, that the stimuli in their environment does not cause them 
to release enough neurotransmitters to fit into all the necessary 
receptor sites. Messages don't pass from one neuron to another as 
easily as they do for those of us without ADHD. Their thresholds 
are high. Kids with ADHD fidget and squirm in order to provide 
extra stimulation, which translates into more keys fitting into 
more locks, and they can pass messages efficiently. Ever studied 
something intensely and then noticed that your leg was bouncing? 
Same thing. You were bouncing your leg to stimulate yourself and 
send a sufficient number of neurotransmitters into the synapse. 
When kids have to stimulate themselves, it can be hard on everyone around them, since this translates into bouncing off the walls.</i></font></p>
Yvonne Kao adds these three points in her comments, excerpted here: 
<p><font size="-1"><i>1. Improved cognition associated with improved physical fitness 
and motor coordination. There's lots of research showing this 
correlation exists and it may drive the effect you observe with 
jumping rope.<br/>
2. Improved cognition because you are not wasting cognitive capacity inhibiting movement your body wants to make by default. 
Typical people do not naturally sit perfectly still all the time, 
much less an ADHD child.<br/>
3. Improved cognition because, having recently expended a bunch 
of physical energy, your body naturally wants to move less to compensate, and thus you don't have so much movement to inhibit to 
begin with, freeing up cognitive capacity for thinking.</i></font></p>

<h3>neuroscience</h3>
<b><h2>What is the neurological basis of 
curiosity?</h2>
Bradley Voytek, Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of 
California, Berkeley and post-doctoral fellow at UCSF.</b>
<p>Well, gosh. My answer just got all long and philosophical and 
talky. This question (or rather, the sub-question) doesn't make 
sense, in a neuroscientific sense.</p>
<p>The question itself is of a type that is commonly asked 
in cognitive neuroscience: where is &lt;vague behavior&gt; in the 
brain?</p>
<p>But what does it even mean to ask where "curiosity" is in 
the brain? What would an answer look like?<br/>
According to one article:</p>
<p><font size="-1">In study after study, scientists have found that the striatum lit 
up like an inferno of activity when people didn&rsquo;t know exactly 
what was going to happen next, when they were on the verge of 
solving their mystery and hoped to be rewarded &mdash; it was more 
active then, in fact, than when people received their reward and 
had their curiosity satisfied. (http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/
article/item/wired_to_wonder/)</font></p>
<p>"So," you may ask, "what's wrong with that answer? That 
seems reasonable and sound and very sciencey!"<br/>
You just got brain-mesmerized!<br/>
I can prove, with one statement, that this answer is wrong </p>
(if you're impatient, jump to point 2 at the bottom).
<p>So what is wrong with this explanation (he says, finally 
getting to the damned point)? I'll break both of these points 
down in detail later.</p>
<font size="-1">1.</font>
The question is phrased in such a way that it presumes 
that "curiosity" is a singular thing.
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
The question presumes that a complex behavior or emotion can be localized to a brain region or regions. There 
are several philosophical pitfalls packaged into the answer, such as the ontological commitment to the narrative 
of cognitive neuroscience and the cerebral localization of 
function.</p>
<p>To be clear, what I'm not saying is that behaviors aren't in the 
brain. What I am saying is that the cerebral localization narrative is too simplistic.</p>
<p>Let me break down these points.<br/>
1. is curiosity a singular thing<font size="-2">?</font></p>
<p>When you ask "where is curiosity in the brain," you assume 
that researchers can somehow isolate curiosity from other 
emotions and behaviors in a lab and dissect it apart. This is 
very, very difficult, if not impossible. neuroimaging (almost 
always) relies on the notion of cognitive subtraction, which 
is a way of comparing your behavior or emotion of interest 
(curiosity) against some baseline state that is not curiosity.</p>
or, as I say in my book chapter from <i>The Mind and the 
Frontal Lobes</i>:
<p><font size="-1">The underlying assumption in these studies is that activity in 
brain networks alters in a task-dependent manner that becomes 
evident after averaging many event-related responses and comparing those against a baseline condition. Deviations from this 
baseline reflect a change in the neuronal processing demands 
required to perform the task of interest.</font></p>
2. can curiosity Be localiZed to one Brain region<font size="-1">?</font>
<p>no, it cannot. Here's how I know: I've personally worked with 
people who have a severely damaged striatum. Know what? 
They still have curiostiy. If the striatum is where curiosity is 
in the brain, how can someone whose striata are gone still 
have curiosty? They cannot. Yet they do. Poof. Hypothesis disproved.</p>
<p>Imagine asking, "Where is video located in my computer?" 
That doesn't make any sense. Your monitor is required to see 
the video. Your graphics card is required to render the video. 
The software is required to generate the code for the video. 
But the "video" isn't located anywhere in the computer.</p>
<p>now there's a subtlety here. It may be that people with 
damaged striata have curiosity impairments (whatever that 
means), which would agree with the fMRI study discussed in 
that link above, but it proves that the striatum is not where 
curiosity is in the brain. More technically: the striatum may 
be a critical part of a network of brain regions that support 
curiosity behaviors, but that is different from saying that the 
striatum is where curiosity is.</p>
or, as I say in my chapter:
<p><font size="-1">The cognitive subtraction method</font>
 . . .<font size="-1"> provide[s] details of 
functional localization that can then be tested and corroborated 
using other methodologies, including lesion studies. The interpretation of these localization results is confounded, however, by 
a lack of clarity in what is meant for a "function" to be localized. 
For example, Young and colleagues (2000) noted that for a 
given function to be localizable, that function "must be capable 
of being considered both structurally and functionally discrete;" 
a property that the brain is incapable of assuming due to the 
intricate, large-scale neuronal interconnectivity.</font></p>
<font color="#FF0000"><p><font size="-1">Thus, discussing behavioral functions outside of the context of 
the larger cortical and subcortical networks involved with that 
function is a poorly posed problem. Therefore, the scientific 
study of cognition requires detailed neuroanatomical and connectivity information to compliment functional activity findings.</font></p>
Anyway, this prompted me to write a whole blog post with 
link to papers, etc. about this topic: http://blog.ketyov.</font>

<h3>life</h3>
<b><h2>Why do living things die?</h2>
Paul King, Computational Neuroscientist, Software Entrepreneur</b><br/>
It's not that living things die; it's that multicellular organisms 
die. But why?<br/>
every single-celled organism alive today has been in exis<p>tence since life began over three billion years ago. This is because individual cells do not give birth, they divide. After cell 
division, the two cells that result are each as old as the single 
cell that preceded them. The cell does not become younger 
by dividing. (Although this may not be exactly true, see: [1].)</p>
<p>Thus every cell in your body is over three billion years old.
The strategy that multicellular organisms such as humans 
use to project themselves into the future is to create new cell 
colonies from a single undifferentiated cell rather than maintaining existing colonies indefinitely. The main reason is that 
reproduction is more flexible and robust than maintenance, 
and it provides a way of starting over with a "clean slate" and 
slightly different genes. Complex organisms accumulate billions of errors and problems over their lifetime. Most of these 
errors are fixed as fast as they happen, but life takes a toll and 
not all problems are reversible. Just as reinstalling Microsoft
Windows every so often fixes accumulated system issues, so 
does generating a new organism every so often from a single 
cell.</p>
<p>Given that biology has selected this strategy, evolution has 
optimized for producing the most successful offspring. once 
the individual has reproduced, its only evolutionary role is to 
support the success of its offspring. Aging longer is just not 
something evolution has had a reason to optimize. And in fact 
given limited environmental resources, the offspring often do 
better if the older generation doesn't stay around forever competing with younger generations for scarce resources.</p>
<p>In terms of what happens physiologically, there are two 
main contributors to aging.<br/>
The first is the accumulation of biological defects. Viruses 
and disease take a toll even after healing; UV rays slowly but 
inevitably damage DnA; and proteins, cell structure, and the 
neurons which hold memories all degrade over time due to 
thermodynamic molecular disruptions and invasions by other 
species.<br/>
The second is the aging process itself. The organism develops to maturity and ages in stages according to a genetically 
determined life plan. Muscles atrophy, bones brittle, and metabolism changes. But the life plan has never run more than 
eighty years until recently, and evolution only ever optimized 
the first forty years or so. So humans are in new territory that 
is poorly understood, and which evolution has never had a 
reason to fine tune.<br/>
It may be possible to slow or stop some of the genetically 
determined aging processes. While this may not be good for 
an overpopulated planet, it is sure to be popular with those 
that can afford the medical intervention. Let's just hope the 
social security system holds out!</p>

 There is evidence that even in "symmetric" cell division, 
one child cell may be slightly "younger" (less prone to 
death) than the other. See: Stewert eJ, et al (2005). Aging

<h3>economics</h3>
<b><h2>What are the economics of lying?</h2>
Ben Golub, Economics Ph.D., Stanford [GSB]</b><br/>
summary
<p>Lying was one of the first issues to be studied by the founders 
of game theory &mdash; they focused on bluffing in one-shot poker 
as a basic model. The idea is that with some probability, you 
randomly play aggressively even though you have bad cards. 
With some positive probability, the other side folds when that 
happens, because you also play aggressively when you have 
good cards. This notion of <b>mixed strategies</b> as a way to create 
uncertainty in your opponent is a very fundamental notion in 
game theory.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 More modern theories have models of lying with <b>many 
periods</b> and can explain dynamic phenomena where an 
antagonistic type <b>imitates the good type </b>to "<b>build credibility,</b>" then <b>burns that reputation</b> at an opportune time 
when he can benefit the most by deceiving the other player.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Some innovative economic theorists believe that economists don't really have a good model of lying because <b>in 
classic game theory nobody is ever truly deceived</b>: they 
know the exact probability that the other side is not "telling the truth" and they just do the best they can under the 
circumstances. Modern research is trying to create models that involve "real deception," where people are genuinely led astray in their beliefs.</p>
longer version
<p>This is a wonderful question because the issue of deception 
brings out some of the best successes and the greatest flaws 
in economic theory &mdash; particularly game theory, the area in 
which lying has been studied most.</p>
<p>The simplest and oldest notions of "deception" go back 
to the very beginnings of modern game theory. This paper 
(http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/papers/poker1.pdf) discusses Borel's and von neumann's models of two-person, 
zero-sum poker with bluffing, which were published in the 
1930s. John nash's 1950 dissertation (http://www.princeton.
edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/non-Cooperative_Games_nash.
pdf, scan of the original, page 32) contains a simple poker 
game in which agents can bluff, opening with some probability even when they have bad cards. of course, there is nothing 
intrinsic in choosing to open that says, "I have good cards;" it 
is just an action in the game. And, in equilibrium, your opponent knows exactly what the probability is that you have 
a good hand when you "claim to." The reason that he can't 
completely disregard the claim is that you sometimes behave 
aggressively when you Do have a good hand. In these simple, 
static (one period) models of lying, the credibility of the bluff
is supported by the possibility that it is not a bluff.</p>
<p>The more modern literature has focused on dynamic 
(multi-period) models, in which one can tell more elaborate 
stories about "building and destroying credibility." one standard approach can be illustrated by a classic model introduced 
by Joel Sobel in the article "A Theory of Credibility" [<i>Review 
of Economic Studies</i> (1985) 52(4) pp. 557-573]. There are two 
agents: a king and a spy. The king is unsure about the motivations of the spy, who might want to help the king or might 
be a double agent whose motivations are exactly opposed to 
those of the king. every month, a diplomatic issue comes up 
with its own level of importance. The spy observes what would 
be best for the king and advises an action (say, A or B). After 
the action, the king learns whether it was the right action to 
take. </p>
<p>In equilibrium, a double agent builds credibility by giving 
the king good advice for a while. Then he advises the king to 
do the wrong thing for the king when a sufficiently important 
issue comes up. After that, the double agent has been outed, 
but has benefited in one high-stakes issue.</p>
This illustrates many of the standard ingredients in economic models of deception:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Asymmetric information: at least one agent's "type" or motivation is unknown to the other(s).<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Pooling: certain types (spies in the example) behave like 
other types ("pool on the same action"), making it impossible for the opposite side (the king) to figure out who is 
who until one type (usually the "bad" type) reveals himself.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Building reputation (for credibility, e.g.) and then burning it at an opportune time.
<p>The study of such models has become a very active area in 
game theory. An excellent scholarly monograph on this field 
is <i> Repeated Games and Reputations: Long Run Relationships </i>by George Mailath and Larry Sameulson (http://www.
amazon.com/Repeated-Games-Reptions-Long-Run-Relationships/dp/0195300793/) &mdash; but note that this is an advanced 
graduate textbook with lots of math.</p>
<p>A final big-picture remark: in these game-theoretic models, nobody is actually being tricked. Agents have accurate 
beliefs about what the other side is doing (that's the definition of a nash equilibrium) and are doing the best they can. 
Several innovative economic theorists at Stanford (Yossi 
Feinberg, Matt Jackson) have remarked that, for this reason, 
there isn't really a good model of lying in economics [1]. Real 
lying should involve the target being, at least potentially, an 
"unsuspecting victim" who really believes what he has been 
told. A recent paper that seems to move in this direction is by 
ettinger and Jehiel ["A Theory of Deception", <i>American Economic Journal: Microeconomics</i> 2010, 2(1), pp. 1-20, http://
www.enpc.fr/ceras/jehiel/deception.pdf].</p>

 note, for example, that a usual justification for accurate 
beliefs in equilibrium is that players have been playing 
this kind of game a lot, and have a sense for how often the 
truth matches the plain-language meaning of a particular 
statement. Maybe that's true when five people have been 
playing poker together for a long time. But important lies 
are often told "out of equilibrium," when there is no reason 
to believe that players have a good "read" of the likelihood 
that a claim is true.</p>

mathematics?</h2>

<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You can answer many seemingly difficult questions quickly.</b> But you are not very impressed by what can look like 
magic, because you know the trick. The trick is that your 
brain can quickly decide if question is answerable by one 
of a few powerful general purpose "machines" (e.g., continuity arguments, the correspondences between geometric 
and algebraic objects, linear algebra, ways to reduce the 
infinite to the finite through various forms of compactness) combined with specific facts you have learned about 
your area. The number of fundamental ideas and techniques that people use to solve problems is, perhaps surprisingly, pretty small &mdash; see http://www.tricki.org/tricki/
map for a partial list, maintained by Timothy Gowers.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You are often confident that something is true long before you have an airtight proof for it (this happens especially often in geometry). </b>The main reason is that you 
have a large catalogue of connections between concepts, 
and you can quickly intuit that if X were to be false, that 
would create tensions with other things you know to be 
true, so you are inclined to believe X is probably true to 
maintain the harmony of the conceptual space. It's not so 
much that you can imagine the situation perfectly, but you 
can quickly imagine many other things that are logically 
connected to it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You are comfortable with feeling like you have no deep 
understanding of the problem you are studying.</b> Indeed, when you do have a deep understanding, you have 
solved the problem, and it is time to do something else. 
This makes the total time you spend in life reveling in 
your mastery of something quite brief. one of the main 
skills of research scientists of any type is knowing how to 
work comfortably and productively in a state of confusion. 
More on this in the next few bullets.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Your intuitive thinking about a problem is productive 
and usefully structured, wasting little time on being aimlessly puzzled. </b>For example, when answering a question 
about a high-dimensional space (e.g., whether a certain 
kind of rotation of a five-dimensional object has a "fixed 
point" that does not move during the rotation), you do not 
spend much time straining to visualize those things that 
do not have obvious analogues in two and three dimensions. (Violating this principle is a huge source of frustration for beginning maths students who don't know that 
they shouldn't be straining to visualize things for which 
they don't seem to have the visualizing machinery.) Instead . . .</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>When trying to understand a new thing, you automatically focus on very simple examples that are easy to think 
about, and then you leverage intuition about the examples into more impressive insights.</b> For example, you 
might imagine two- and three-dimensional rotations that 
are analogous to the one you really care about, and think 
about whether they clearly do or don't have the desired 
property. Then you think about what was important to the 
examples and try to distill those ideas into symbols. often, 
you see that the key idea in the symbolic manipulations 
doesn't depend on anything about two or three dimensions, and you know how to answer your hard question. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
As you get more mathematically advanced, the examples 
you consider easy are actually complex insights built up 
from many easier examples; the "simple case" you think 
about now took you two years to become comfortable 
with. But at any given stage, you do not strain to obtain 
a magical illumination about something intractable; you 
work to reduce it to the things that feel friendly.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
To me, the <b>biggest misconception that non-mathematicians have about how mathematicians think is that there 
is some mysterious mental faculty that is used to crack 
a problem all at once</b>. In reality, one can ever think only 
a few moves ahead, trying out possible attacks from one's 
arsenal on simple examples relating to the problem, trying 
to establish partial results, or looking to make analogies 
with other ideas one understands. This is the same way 
that one solves problems in one's first real maths courses 
in university and in competitions. What happens as you 
get more advanced is simply that the arsenal grows larger, 
the thinking gets somewhat faster due to practice, and you 
have more examples to try, perhaps making better guesses 
about what is likely to yield progress. Sometimes, during 
this process, a sudden insight comes, but it would not be 
possible without the painstaking groundwork (http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-agenius-to-do-maths/). </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Indeed, most of the bullet points here summarize feelings 
familiar to many serious students of mathematics who are 
in the middle of their undergraduate careers; as you learn 
more mathematics, these experiences apply to "bigger" 
things but have the same fundamental flavor.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You go up in abstraction, "higher and higher." The main 
object of study yesterday becomes just an example or a 
tiny part of what you are considering today.</b> For example, 
in calculus classes you think about functions or curves. 
In functional analysis or algebraic geometry, you think of 
spaces whose <i>points</i> are functions or curves &mdash; that is, you 
"zoom out" so that every function is just a point in a space, 
surrounded by many other "nearby" functions. Using this 
kind of zooming out technique, you can say very complex 
things in short sentences &mdash; things that, if unpacked and 
said at the zoomed-in level, would take up pages. Abstracting and compressing in this way allows you to consider 
extremely complicated issues while using your limited 
memory and processing power.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>The particularly "abstract" or "technical" parts of many 
other subjects seem quite accessible because they boil 
down to maths you already know. You generally feel 
confident about your ability to learn most quantitative 
ideas and techniques. </b>A theoretical physicist friend likes 
to say, only partly in jest, that there should be books titled 
"______ for Mathematicians," where ______ is something 
generally believed to be difficult (quantum chemistry, general relativity, securities pricing, formal epistemology). 
Those books would be short and pithy, because many key 
concepts in those subjects are ones that mathematicians 
are well equipped to understand. often, those parts can be 
explained more briefly and elegantly than they usually are 
if the explanation can assume a knowledge of maths and 
a facility with abstraction. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Learning the domain-specific elements of a different field 
can still be hard &mdash; for instance, physical intuition and 
economic intuition seem to rely on tricks of the brain that 
are not learned through mathematical training alone. But 
the quantitative and logical techniques you sharpen as 
a mathematician allow you to take many shortcuts that 
make learning other fields easier, as long as you are willing to be humble and modify those mathematical habits 
that are not useful in the new field.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You move easily between multiple seemingly very different ways of representing a problem</b>. For example, most 
problems and concepts have more algebraic representations (closer in spirit to an algorithm) and more geometric ones (closer in spirit to a picture). You go back and 
forth between them naturally, using whichever one is 
more helpful at the moment. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Indeed, some of the most powerful ideas in mathematics 
(e.g., duality, Galois theory, algebraic geometry, provide 
"dictionaries" for moving between "worlds" in ways that, <i>ex 
ante</i>, are very surprising. For example, Galois theory allows us to use our understanding of symmetries of shapes 
(e.g., rigid motions of an octagon) to understand why you 
can solve any fourth-degree polynomial equation in closed 
form, but not any fifth-degree polynomial equation. once 
you know these threads between different parts of the universe, you can use them like wormholes to extricate yourself from a place where you would otherwise be stuck. The 
next two bullets expand on this.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Spoiled by the power of your best tools, you tend to shy 
away from messy calculations or long, case-by-case arguments unless they are absolutely unavoidable.</b> Mathematicians develop a powerful attachment to elegance 
and depth, which are in tension with, if not directly opposed to, mechanical calculation. Mathematicians will 
often spend days figuring out why a result follows easily 
from some very deep and general pattern that is already 
well-understood, rather than from a string of calculations. 
Indeed, you tend to choose problems <i>motivated</i> by how 
likely it is that there will be some "clean" insight in them, 
as opposed to a detailed but ultimately unenlightening 
proof by exhaustively enumerating a bunch of possibilities. (nevertheless, detailed calculation of an example is 
often a crucial part of beginning to see what is really going on in a problem; and, depending on the field, <i>some </i>
calculation often plays an essential role even in the best 
proof of a result.)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
In<i> A Mathematician's Apology,</i> (http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss/misc/A%20Mathematician's%20Apology.pdf, 
the most poetic book I know on what it is "like" to be a 
mathematician), G.H. Hardy wrote:</p>
<font size="-1"><p>"In both [these example] theorems (and in the theorems, of 
course, I include the proofs) there is a very high degree of 
unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy. The 
arguments take so odd and surprising a form; the weapons used 
seem so childishly simple when compared with the far-reaching 
results; but there is no escape from the conclusions. There are 
no complications of detail &mdash; one line of attack is enough in 
each case; and this is true too of the proofs of many much more 
difficult theorems, the full appreciation of which demands quite 
a high degree of technical proficiency. We do not want many 
&lsquo;variations&rsquo; in the proof of a mathematical theorem: &lsquo;enumeration of cases&rsquo;, indeed, is one of the duller forms of mathematical 
argument. A mathematical proof should resemble a simple and

<b> You develop a strong aesthetic preference for powerful and general ideas that connect hundreds of difficult 
questions, as opposed to resolutions of particular puzzles.</b> Mathematicians don't really care about "the answer" 
to any particular question; even the most sought-after theorems, like Fermat's Last Theorem http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem, are only tantalizing 
because their difficulty tells us that we have to develop 
very good tools and understand very new things to have 
a shot at proving them. It is what we get in the process, 
and not the answer <i>per se</i>, that is the valuable thing. The 
accomplishment a mathematician seeks is finding a new 
dictionary or wormhole between different parts of the 
conceptual universe. As a result, many mathematicians do 
not focus on deriving the practical or computational implications of their studies (which can be a drawback of the 
hyper-abstract approach!); instead, they simply want to 
find the most powerful and general connections. Timothy 
Gowers has some interesting comments on this issue, and 
disagreements within the mathematical community about 
it (https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/2cultures.pdf.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Understanding something abstract or proving that something is true becomes a task a lot like building something. </b>You think: "First I will lay this foundation, then I 
will build this framework using these familiar pieces, but 
leave the walls to fill in later, then I will test the beams . . . " 
All these steps have mathematical analogues, and structuring things in a modular way allows you to spend several days thinking about something you do not understand 
without feeling lost or frustrated. (I should say, "without 
feeling unbearably lost and frustrated; some amount of 
these feelings is inevitable, but the key is to reduce them 
to a tolerable degree.)</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, used 
an "exploring" metaphor:
<p><font size="-1">"Perhaps I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of a journey through a dark unexplored mansion. 
You enter the first room of the mansion and it's completely 
dark. You stumble around bumping into the furniture, but 
gradually you learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally, 
after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, 
and suddenly it's all illuminated. You can see exactly where you 
were. Then you move into the next room and spend another 
six months in the dark. So each of these breakthroughs, while 
sometimes they're momentary, sometimes over a period of a 
day or two, they are the culmination of &mdash; and couldn't exist 
without &mdash; the many months of stumbling around in the dark 
that proceed them." (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/

<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>In listening to a seminar or while reading a paper, you 
don't get stuck as much as you used to</b> in youth because 
you are good at modularizing a conceptual space, taking 
certain calculations or arguments you don't understand as 
"black boxes," and considering their implications anyway. 
You can sometimes make statements you know are true 
and have good intuition for, without understanding all the 
details. You can often detect where the delicate or interesting part of something is based on only a very high-level 
explanation. (I first saw these phenomena highlighted by 
Ravi Vakil, who offers insightful advice on being a mathematics student: http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html.)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> You are good at generating your own definitions and 
your own questions in thinking about some new kind of 
abstraction.</b></p>
<p>one of the things one learns fairly late in a typical mathematical education (often only at the stage of starting to do 
research) is how to make good, useful definitions. Something I've reliably heard from people who know parts of 
mathematics well but never went on to be professional 
mathematicians (i.e., write articles about new mathematics for a living) is that they were good at proving difficult 
propositions that were stated in a textbook exercise, but 
would be lost if presented with a mathematical structure 
and asked to find and prove some interesting facts about 
it. Concretely, the ability to do this amounts to being good 
at making definitions and, using the newly defined concepts, formulating precise results that other mathematicians find intriguing or enlightening. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 This kind of challenge is like being given a world and 
asked to find events in it that come together to form a 
good detective story. Unlike a more standard detective, 
you have to figure out what the "crime" (interesting question) might be; you'll you have to generate your own 
"clues" by building up deductively from the basic axioms. 
To do these things, you use analogies with other detective 
stories (mathematical theories) that you know and a taste 
for what is surprising or deep. How this process works is 
perhaps the most difficult aspect of mathematical work to 
describe precisely but also the thing that I would guess is 
the strongest thing that mathematicians have in common.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You are easily annoyed by imprecision in talking about 
the quantitative or logical. </b>This is mostly because you are 
trained to quickly think about counterexamples that make 
an imprecise claim seem obviously false.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>On the other hand, you are very comfortable with intentional imprecision or "hand-waving" in areas you know, 
because you know how to fill in the details. </b>Terence Tao 
is very eloquent about this here (http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/there%e2%80%99s-more-tomathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/): </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
"[After learning to think rigorously, comes the] 'post-rigorous' stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all 
the rigorous foundations of one&rsquo;s chosen field, and is now 
ready to revisit and refine one&rsquo;s pre-rigorous intuition on 
the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage one 
would be able to quickly and accurately perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with scalar 
calculus, or informal and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-o notation, and so forth, and be able to convert 
all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever 
required.) The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, 
and the 'big picture.' This stage usually occupies the late 
graduate years and beyond."</p>
<p>In particular, an idea that took hours to understand correctly the first time ("for any arbitrarily small epsilon I can 
find a small delta so that this statement is true") becomes 
such a basic element of your later thinking that you don't 
give it conscious thought.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Before wrapping up, it is worth mentioning that mathematicians are not immune to the limitations faced by most 
others. They are not typically intellectual superheroes. For 
instance, they often become resistant to new ideas and 
uncomfortable with ways of thinking (even about mathematics) that are not their own. They can be defensive 
about intellectual turf, dismissive of others, or petty in 
their disputes. Above, I have tried to summarize how the 
mathematical way of thinking feels and works at its best, 
without focusing on personality flaws of mathematicians 
or on the politics of various mathematical fields. These issues are worthy of their own long answers!</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>You are humble about your knowledge because you are 
aware of how weak maths is, and you are comfortable 
with the fact that you can say nothing intelligent about 
most problems</b>. There are only very few mathematical 
questions to which we have reasonably insightful answers. 
There are even fewer questions, obviously, to which <i>any 
given</i> mathematician can give a good answer. After two 
or three years of a standard university curriculum, a good 
maths undergraduate can effortlessly write down hundreds of mathematical questions to which the very best 
mathematicians could not venture even a tentative answer. (The theoretical computer scientist Richard Lipton 
lists some examples of potentially "deep" ignorance here: 
http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/mathematicalembarrassments/.) This makes it more comfortable to be 
stumped by most problems; a sense that you know roughly 
what questions are tractable and which are currently far 
beyond our abilities is humbling, but also frees you from 
being very intimidated, because you do know you are familiar with the most powerful apparatus we have for dealing with these kinds of problems.</p>

<b><h2>Given our current technology and 
with the proper training, would it 
be possible for someone to become 
Batman?</h2>
Mark Hughes, Screenwriter, Forbes Blogger</b><br/>
I know everyone hates having a question answered with "it 
depends,"  but . . .
<p>It depends. WHICH Batman, the one in the current film 
franchise, the one from the current monthlies, the one from 
the Justice League, etc etc?</p>
<p>I am going to make an assumption here, in order to best 
answer your question. We'll put aside the issue of Batman 
trained by ninjas in the films, or the question of whether in 
the comics Batman operates with sort-of-superpowers when 
interacting in stories alongside Superman and other such 
characters. By "become Batman," you mean the basic concept 
of Batman that we all could agree upon &mdash; a master of martial 
arts, of forensic and detective skills, of gymnastics, of science 
and chemistry, of history and geography, of the workings of 
organized crime, of criminal psychology and physiology, and a 
man with a suit offering protection against bullets and knives 
and electrocution but which allows him to move as fast as an 
olympian runner and acrobat.</p>
<p>The simple answer is, no. Unless you really boil Batman 
down to a very diluted level as just a really strong, fast, good 
fighter who can jump far and with good street smarts plus an 
education in crime and psychology, and who wears a lot of 
armor and a mask.</p>
<p>The genius of Batman is that it 
<i>pretends </i>to be realistic, it 
lets us convince ourselves that with enough money and training, <i>we </i>could become Batman, too. But it's still fantasy, it's 
just a fantasy that is more compelling and convincing and 
thus more fun.</p>
<p>If you joined the military and became something like a 
Delta Force commando of the highest quality, while studying 
nights to get a double-major in criminal justice and psychology (with a minor in chemistry), then you might <i>also</i> have 
time to take weekend courses in detective work and get a P.I. 
license. Then, after probably ten years to reach all of those levels combined, you might be twenty-eight (if you started right 
out of high school) and would then need to maintain your 
physical level while getting a job as a police officer in order to 
learn real crime-solving and detective work on the streets and 
at crime scenes, to get the experience it would really take to 
be a master. Let's say you are so good it only takes you perhaps 
three years to become a top detective and expert in these regards &mdash; now you are thirty-one, and you just finished the most 
basic level of preparation you need to be an expert in just 
some of the most obvious fields required to match Batman.</p>
<p>now you have to quit the force, and develop a good cover 
story for yourself so nobody suspects that Batman might be 
the guy who is an expert in all of those fields Batman is a master at. You have to have made sure you lived your life never 
revealing your true feelings about crime and vigilantism etc, 
and in fact covering it up unless you want to be arrested as 
a suspect the first time Batman has been around town. You 
need to spend some time doing dry runs around town to find 
your way around rooftops and fire escapes, practice running 
around at night in the shadows and not being seen, and presumably start practicing using your ropes and grappling 
hooks and other equipment you need for nightly patrols. Do 
some dry runs, make final preparations in case of emergencies, etc.</p>
<p>And you need to have been investing money and amassing 
a fortune the entire time, because the technology you'll need 
to even get close to a real-world version of Batman will cost 
millions of dollars. So you've done that, and now you start 
spending the money to get an armored suit full of electronics 
to communicate with assistants and have night vision and so 
on. You need a base of operations, so you buy one of those 
old used missile silos the military sells (yeah, they really do 
that, and it's pretty cool inside them) and turn it into a secret 
headquarters for the computers and monitoring equipment 
and car and bike and other equipment you need for your vigilante life.</p>
<p>Conservatively, you should probably be about thirty-two at 
this point. And you are only about to go out on your first night 
as Batman. okay, it's taken longer than expected and been 
pretty hard, and honestly you are not quite as much a master 
of all fields as Batman, but at least you got the basics and are 
pretty well trained and smart and equipped. So off you go, 
looking  to  stop  crime . . .</p>
<p>. . . and you're looking. And looking. oh, wait, you hear police sirens or you get a transmission from picking up the police radio calls, there's a domestic disturbance in progress . . .
well, that's not really what Batman does, so you let that one 
go to the cops. Then you get another call about a robbery, 
ah ha! Finally Batman is going into action! You run across 
those rooftops, swing across to another roof &mdash; whoa crap, 
that was a lot more dangerous than it looks in the comics! 
But you're booking it, running flat out and probably hitting, 
what, a good ten miles per hour? Maybe less actually because 
of having to dodge things and stop at the edge of the roof to 
swing down again.</p>
<p>Anyway, there you are, rooftop to rooftop, and it occurs to 
you that the cop cars are so far gone now that you barely hear 
the sirens. So you think, "Hmm, no wonder the real Batman 
has a car, this rooftop thing looks cool, but I'll never make it 
in time to stop a crime that isn't happening within a block or 
two."</p>
<p>And you don't &mdash; make it in time, that is. The first few 
nights, you keep showing up and the robberies or shootings 
or whatever are already over, and you realize that this makes 
sense because most reports about crimes are only after it happens, not while it's taking place. And you also remember that 
as a cop, you almost never just walked up or drove up accidentally right where a crime happened to taking place. In 
fact, you were just one of several thousand cops in your city, 
and most of you never just stumbled right across a significant 
crime in progress.</p>
<p>By your second week, you are getting unhappy that 90% of 
the crimes you've even seen up-close are just pathetic junkies 
buying crack from another pathetic junkie selling drugs to 
support his/her own habit. And nothing makes you feel LeSS 
like Batman than scaring sad homeless crackheads. You tried 
to chase down a kid who you saw punch a lady and take her 
purse, but you can't really pursue that kind of thing by running on rooftops, you gotta do it the hard way by chasing him 
on foot down the sidewalk . . . in your full Batman costume, 
where everybody can see you. People are taking photos on 
cell-phones, and yep, there's a cop car at the intersection and 
he saw you, and now he has his lights on and it's YoU he's 
after. Great, you have to let the kid go so you can run down an 
alley and climb up a fire escape to the roof to get away.</p>
<p>At last, week three, you get lucky &mdash; an armed robbery, 
right there across the street! You leap down onto the hood 
of their car, cape over the windshield just like in <i>The Dark 
Knight Returns.</i> And a teenage kid in the passenger seat fires 
a shotgun though the windshield in panic, blasting your torso.</p>
<p>You are wearing armor, though, haha! So it merely shreds 
your costume and knocks you off the car onto the street, 
but man that <i>hurts! </i>And it takes your breath away just long 
enough for the car to speed off. You get up, angry and just in 
time to see everyone taking your photo again and staring at 
your shredded outfit. Then the police come around the corner, 
and you run off again but this time you are injured because 
although the armor stopped the slug it still bruised you and 
broke a rib. You are fast, but not fast enough this time. The 
police draw their guns and order you to stop. You turn and 
grab for the smoke pellet on your belt to help hide your getaway, but unfortunately for you the cops see you reaching for 
something and open fire . . . and your suit's armor is already a 
mess from the shotgun blast earlier. Uh oh.</p>
<p>When you wake up in the ICU, your mask and costume 
are gone, you're in a lot of pain, but the doctors successfully 
removed the bullets and re-inflated your lung. The downside 
is the set of handcuffs trapping you in the bed. As a master 
detective, you can of course easily pick the lock on the cuffs to 
escape, but on the other hand, the staph infection you caught 
after surgery is pretty bad and you feel like s**t. So you wait 
until night to sneak out &mdash; except you fall asleep on your pain 
meds, and wake up the next morning to the police coming to 
pick you up and take you to the infirmary at the state prison. 
Where you will spend a month recuperating until they can 
transfer you to the county jail for your first court appearance. 
During which your only comment to the judge is, "I guess it's 
not really possible to become Batman."</p>

<p>As in the comics, the Joker regards the past as a mutable

the act of remembering and forgetting is, in fact, creation and 
destruction. Was the Joker the leader of the Red Hood gang? 
A failed stand-up comic forced into crime by the gang he appeared to be leading? Did his wife die in an accident? Was 
she murdered by a corrupt cop? Did she exist at all? Because 
the Joker is able to forget and remember at will, the truth is 
whatever version of his backstory that he is remembering at 
any moment, regardless of whether that history conflicts with 
what he remembered yesterday.<br/>

<p><font size="-1">[Beasts] do not remember; mankind does. Man is an historical 
animal, whose memories weigh down upon him. Happiness is 
forgetting, though remembering is what gives man the ability to 
utilize lessons from the past in the present.</font></p>
In some sense, the Joker is a nietzchian ideal: a man with 
total control over both remethmbering and forgetting.
<p>This is what makes him a nemesis of the Batman: Bruce 
Wayne cannot forget anything. The deaths of his parents, of 
(in the comics) the second Robin, of (in the movie) his oldest friend, these memories and this history are the essential 
components of his character. every action is motivated by 
memory and history he is unable or unwilling to escape.</p>

<h3>actors and actresses</h3>
<b><h2>How do actors' spouses feel about 
love scenes in film and TV?</h2>
Marcus Geduld, Artistic Director, Folding Chair Classical 
Theatre, NYC (foldingchairtheatre.org)</b>
<p>I'm a theatre director (with a tiny amount of experience in 
television), but I don't imagine the dynamics are much different in theatre than in film or television. of course, different 
people feel differently, and there probably are some who get 
jealous. What I write here is based on my own experience and 
the experiences of the many couples I've worked with over 
the years.</p>
<p>My wife is an actress. I have watched her make out on 
stage many times. Some of those have been plays that I've 
directed, and I've had the odd experience (which doesn't feel 
odd to me, but I can see how it would seem odd to an outsider) 
of directing her to kiss another actor more passionately.</p>
It's simply not a big deal, and I don't feel jealous. I remember feeling funny the first time, but the 900th time, in 
rehearsal, you watch a kiss, it ceased to be very meaningful. 
<p>There are a lot of factors that tend to make this stuff nobig-deal. First of all, everyone in the business understands, 
going in, that it's part of the business. It's not a surprise or 
anything. I work with an ensemble of actors, and I think, by 
now, most of them have played sex scenes together. no one 
cares. We joke about it.</p>
<p>Second, it's almost never sexy. It's choreographed. You 
simply can't tell two actors to "go at it" and let them improvise. 
no one in the audience would see anything. Heads would be 
in the way, etc. It's even less romantic in the film world, where 
there are camera men in track suits and mics stuck all over 
the place. even if the spouse wasn't there during rehearsal, 
he would know &mdash; just from being married to the actor &mdash; how 
unsexy this stuff is.</p>
<p>(once, when I was acting &mdash; long before I was married 
&mdash; I got to make out with an actress I was very attracted to. 
I was excited beforehand, but in the end it turned out to be 
totally un-titillating. It was by-the-numbers. Turn head, count 
to  three,  press  lips  together . . . )</p>
<p>Added to this, most people in the business, if they stay in 
the business, are very professional and have a good sense of 
humor about this stuff. It's rare for anyone to "pull anything" 
or to try to take advantage of a sex scene. Actors do their work 
and then quit. </p>
<p>Which is not to say there isn't a fantasy element to it. If 
you're playing a bad guy, part of the fun is . . . getting to be the 
bad guy. To get to pretend you're blowing up the White House 
and have a blast doing it. And part of the fun of a sex scene 
is . . .
making  out  with  someone. </p>
<p>I am sure my wife has enjoyed making out with some of 
her co-stars (and I know that she's suffered through others). 
That's human nature, and it doesn't make me jealous or uncomfortable. It would be odd if she hated every minute of it, 
wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is that theatre and film folks 
tend to be very liberal and pretty easy-going about sexual matters. That isn't a coded way of saying, "We're all swingers." 
We're not. But we're very far from being prudes, we're very 
touchy feely in general, and very used to make believe. Someone uncomfortable with this stuff isn't likely to go into acting 
or be married to an actor.</p>
<p>I've noticed a lot of confusion between "actor" and "movie 
star." People are posting things suggesting that actors are 
willing to do all kinds of things for fame and money. </p>
<p>Actors &mdash; as a whole &mdash; don't generally receive either fame 
or lots of money. With a few exceptions, acting is not a lucrative field. Yes, Tom Cruise makes millions, but less than 1% 
of actors are stars. If there's a scene in which Cruise goes to 
Starbucks, the guy behind the counter is just as much an actor as Cruise. </p>
<p>If an actor is in the Screen Actor's Guild, and he's not 
famous, he's likely to earn union scale, which is about $800 
a day. That's not bad, but note that most people in the union 
aren't working every day. There's a lot of competition, and 
too many people for the jobs available, so most actors spend 
a lot of time unemployed or working temp jobs between acting gigs. </p>
<p>They are also not, for the most part, famous. no one remembers what the guy-behind-the-counter looks like. They're 
focusing on Tom Cruise. no one recognizes most actors when 
they walk down the street. </p>
<p>(Actors can also make money from residuals &mdash; payments 
doled out each time, say, an episode of a TV show is aired. 
I have a friend who regularly appears on soaps and shows 
like "Law and order." He's not a "background player." He has 
lines. He just posted on Facebook that he got four residual 
checks in the mail. Together, they total fifty cents.)</p>
<p>It is true that when actors are young and just starting 
out, a lot of them are hoping to become stars. And such folks 
might kiss or have simulated sex in the hopes it will eventually lead to fame and fortune. But once actors have been plying 
their trade for years, they pretty much know that (unless it's 
already happened), they're not likely to become stars. I spend 
most of my like hanging out with actors, and I can promise 
you they don't all talk about "the big break" they're hoping for.</p>
<p>Yet they still engage in screen kisses, and their spouses 
still watch them do this. My wife, for instance, is never likely 
to be rich or famous. She knows it. I know it. And yet I don't 
say, "If this isn't going to lead to you being a star, quit kissing 
people!"</p>
<p>Kissing on stage or film can sometimes be fun, but as I 
and others have posted here, it's usually not. To make sure the 
audience sees everything, it has to be tightly choreographed, 
which takes all the spontaneity out of it. If you don't believe 
this, try the following experiment with your partner: work 
out a bit of kissing choreography that is really tightly controlled: the kiss must take place for such-and-such angle and 
last for exactly X amount of seconds. etc. now do it over and 
over, while a friend watches you and stops you every time you 
deviate a tiny bit from the plan.</p>
<p>So you might ask, if it's not going to lead to fame and fortune, and if it's not even all that much fun, why do people do 
it? And why do people's spouses put up with it?</p>
<p>Actors &mdash; the ones who have realized they're unlikely to 
get rich or famous &mdash; do it because they consider themselves 
to be artists. They love their work (which is telling stories), 
and they take that work very seriously. To noT kiss someone 
when it says to do it in the script would be unprofessional, as 
would be kissing in a half-assed way. It would be like a doctor 
refusing to see a patient or a waiter refusing to serve a patron. 
Most actors I know (and in a couple of decades in the business, I've met thousands) take their craft extremely seriously. </p>
<p>(My wife was once in a show I was directing, and his character was supposed to be really attracted to hers, and yet he 
kept giving her these lame, chaste kisses. The entire cast and 
crew were pissed off at him. It felt as if he was letting us all 
down, making us all look bad by refusing to tell his part of 
the story.)</p>
<p>And most of their spouses are also in the business, so they 
get it. The spouses that aren't in the business tend to get it, 
too. (or those marriages don't last.) They understand that 
their husbands and wives are working hard (and with great 
integrity) and pride, and they support their spouses in that 
effort. For some, it is disconcerting the first few times they 
see their husband or wife kiss a stranger. But people have an 
amazing capacity to adapt. The fiftieth time you see it, and 
note that your partner still stays with you, the kissing starts 
to seem pretty ordinary. </p>
<p>Yes, there are celebrity marriages that fall apart. (This 
happens much less often to non-celebrity actors. For them, 
the divorce rate seems to be about average.) This has little to 
do with the fact that they kiss other celebrities on stage or 
screen. It has much more to do with the way celebrities live 
their lives in general, which tends to involve constant travel 
(time away from spouses) and excessive money and power.</p>

<h3>pixar animation studios</h3>
<b><h2>Did Pixar accidentally delete <i>Toy
Story 2</i> during production?</h2>
Oren Jacob, Associate Technical Director, TS2</b>
<p>I'm the oren Jacob in the video about the lost footage (https://
www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=eL_
g0tyaIee). Hopefully, I can offer some first person color commentary about the video that might serve to answer the questions here. note, after twenty years at the studio, I left Pixar 
last year to start ToyTalk (www.toytalk.com), so this answer 
hasn't gone through any PR filtering, it's straight from my 
foggy memory of those events back in the late 90s.</p>
<p>First, it wasn't multiple terabytes of information. neither 
all the rendered frames, nor all the data necessary to render 
those frames in animation, model, shaders, set, and lighting 
data files were that size back then. </p>
<p>A week prior to driving across the bridge in a last ditch 
attempt to recover the show (depicted pretty accurately in the 
video) we had restored the film from backups within fortyeight hours of the /bin/rm -r -f *, run some validation tests, 
rendered frames, somehow got good pictures back and no 
errors, and invited the crew back to start working. It took 
another several days of the entire crew working on that initial restoral to really understand that the restoral was, in fact, 
incomplete and corrupt. Ack. At that point, we sent everyone 
home again and had the come-to-Jesus meeting where we all 
collectively realized that our backup software wasn't dishing 
up errors properly (a full disk situation was masking them, 
if my memory serves), our validation software also wasn't 
dishing up errors properly (that was written very hastily, and 
without a clean state to start from, was missing several important error conditions), and several other factors were compounding our lack of concrete, verifiable information. </p>
<p>The only prospect then was to roll back about two months 
to the last full backup that we thought might work. In that 
meeting, Galyn mentioned she might have a copy at her 
house. So we went home to get that machine, and you can 
watch the video for how that went . . .</p>
<p>With Galyn's machine now back in the building, we duped 
that data immediately, then set about the task of trying to 
verify and validate this tree, which we thought might be about 
two weeks old. We compared Galyn's restoral with a much 
older one (from two months prior) and couldn't determine 
a clear winner, there were too many inconsistencies. So, instead, we set about the task of assembling what effectively 
amounted to a new source tree, by hand, one file at a time. 
The total number of files involved was well into the six figures, but we'll round down to 100,000 for the sake of the rest 
of this discussion to make the math easier.</p>
<p>We identified the files that hadn't changed between the 
two, and took those straight away. Then there were the files 
that were on Galyn's but not on the older one; we took Galyn's 
and assumed they were new. Then there were files that were 
on the older one but not on Galyn's; we put those in the "hand 
check" pile, since it is unusual for files to be deleted within a 
production source tree, and we were suspicious of those deletions. Then there were the files that were different across the 
two backups, those also went into the "hand check" pile along 
with any files that were touched more recently than Galyn's 
version.</p>
<p>Given that, we had something like 70,000 files that we felt 
good about, and we poured those into a new source tree. For 
the remaining 30,000 files, it was all hands on deck.</p>
<p>We checked things across three partially complete, partially correct trees . . . the two month old full backup (A), Galyn's (B, which we thought was the best one), and another 
cobbled together tree (C) from the stray files left around from 
failed renders, backup directories on animator's machines, 
some heads of source history that were left untouched, verbose test renders, and other random stuff we could find via 
nFS elsewhere in the building.</p>
<p>We invited a select few members of the crew back to work 
straight from Friday to Monday morning. We took rolling 
shifts to sleep and eat and kept plowing through, file by file, 
comparing each of the files in the "to be checked" list from A, 
B, and C, doing the best to verify and validate them, one at a 
time, by looking at them in xdiff. </p>
<p>In the end, human eyes scanned, read, understood, looked 
for weirdness, and made a decision on something like 30,000 
files that weekend. </p>
<p>Having taken our best guesses at those suspect files, we 
assembled a new master of Toy Story 2. Many source histories 
were lost as a result, but we had the best version we could 
pull together. We invited the crew back, and started working 
again. every shot went through a test render, and surprisingly, only a dozen or so failed.</p>
<p>I know full well that the following statement will likely 
blow people's heads up, but the truth is that more than several 
percentage points of the show (as measured in numbers of 
files) were never recovered at all. So how could Toy Story 2 
work at all? We don't know. The frames were rendering (other than that dozen shots), so we just carried on, fixed those 
shots, and charged ahead. At that point, there was nothing 
more that could be done. </p>
<p>And then, some months later, Pixar rewrote the film from 
almost the ground up, and we made Toy Story 2 again. That 
rewritten film was the one you saw in theatres and that you 
can watch now on BluRay.</p>

<h3>movie making</h3>
<b><h2>How do directors conceive and 
think through monster and action 
scenes?</h2>
JJ Abrams, Writer-Director</b>
<p>every scene has its own unique requirements. This is true 
whether it's a comedic scene, a still scene, or a busy scene, a 
scene that's all in-camera vs. one that requires visual effects 
and CGI. As you break down a scene with increasing resolution, the first thing to do is figure out what you want the 
sequence to be and how it serves the story. once you figure 
out what the scene is supposed to do, your mind races trying 
to figure out what would be cool.</p>
<p>In a sequence with a creature, first and foremost you want 
to approach it from as visceral a place as possible. You need 
to figure out what the endgame of the sequence is. once you 
figure that out and what you're going to do, then the fun becomes how you are going to do it. You often begin to come up 
with a sequence, but what you discover is that a dozen shots 
that you thought were critical are actually superfluous. Part 
of what works is sketching it out, either yourself or with a 
storyboard artist. </p>
<p>In terms of visual effects shots, you need to really be as 
practical as you are inspired. Which means you need to be 
able to tell the crew: what we need to build, what we're going 
to shoot live, what we're going to do in-camera, which scenes 
are going to be entirely CG, which are going to be filmed in 
CG, where we're going to create sets, where we're going to be 
creating a piece of the creature physically with special effects, 
etc.</p>
<p>A monster scene is like a magic trick; you're saying "I want 
to put a Testarossa on the stage, I want to cover it with a 
cloth, and I want to rip the cloth away, and I want there to 
be a '67 VW bug." once you know what effect you are trying 
to achieve, then you start getting into the the mechanics and 
working backwards, deconstructing the scene in your head.</p>

<h3>the godfather, part ii</h3>
<b><h2>Why does one of the goons trying 
to kill Frank Pentangelli in the 
bar say, &ldquo;Michael Corleone says, 
&lsquo;Hello&rsquo;&rdquo;?</h2>
Richard Stern, Curious</b>
<p>There are a lot of theories about that line. <br/>
one theory posits that that the entire murder was staged <br/>
by Hyman Roth and the Rosatos to turn Frankie and deliver <br/>
a star witness to the FBI. <br/>
Another supposes that Michael indeed did turn on <br/>
Frankie and hand him over to the Rosatos, fearing that he <br/>
would disrupt the deal with Hyman Roth by continuing to <br/>
antagonize them.<br/>
Yet another maintains that it was simply a gaffe &mdash; and <br/>
that the line should have been read &ldquo;Tell Michael Corleone <br/>
(We or I) says, &lsquo;Hello&rsquo;&rdquo; meaning that the hitman believes <br/>
Michael has already been assassinated or soon will be, and <br/>
Frankie will say hello to him shortly in hell. <br/>
I find none of these particularly satisfying. They all feel a <br/>
little too flimsy for such a meticulously crafted film. 
Instead, I prefer to think that the goal of the Rosatos was <br/>
to indeed kill Frankie. The line was delivered as a final insult. &ldquo;Michael Corleone says, &lsquo;Hello&rsquo;" is a taunt. The Rosatos <br/>
believe Michael is a sap, easily being controlled by Hyman <br/>
Roth, and by association, the Rosatos themselves. Michael <br/>
is weak and easily manipulated in their eyes. He's in their <br/>
pocket. Frankie's loyalty to Michael is misguided and now has <br/>
cost him his life. <br/>
Frankie, by chance, survives the assassination attempt. <br/>
He doesn't believe Michael tried to kill him literally, but he 
believes Michael's lack of power has left him exposed on the 
street. As such, he turns to the FBI for protection. It is only 
when Michael arrives at the Senate hearing with Frankie's 
brother, Frankie recognizes that Michael not only has power, 
but is ruthless enough to use it. not even the US government 
could protect Frankie (and his family) from Michael's vengeance.</p>

<h3>Jeopardy<font size="-1">!</font></h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be a contestant 
on <i>Jeopardy!</i>?</h2>
Neville Fogarty, Back-to-School Week contestant, 2000</b>
Short answer: <b>A lot of fun!</b>
<p>Long answer: okay, I can't stress this enough &mdash; it is really a lot of fun. I was on <i>Jeopardy!</i> in 2000, and I'm writing 
this in 2011 &mdash; I'm nearly twice as old now as I was then, so 
my memory may be a little fuzzy. Also, remember that I was a 
kid, so your <i>Jeopardy!</i> experience may vary. I'm just going to 
tackle what I recall about my trip to Southern California &mdash; 
no audition remarks.</p>
go west
<p>I was flown (coach) with my parents from Bush Intercontinental (Houston) to Los Angeles to stay at the magnificent 
Beverly Hilton Hotel. At the time, the hotel was owned by 
<i>Jeopardy!</i> creator Merv Griffin. There's a shot in the promo 
for the hotel at the end of each show (back then) with the 
hotel's swimming pool in it &mdash; I quickly discovered that everything looks bigger on TV. There was some star-studded gala 
taking place at the hotel in the evening. The most famous person I saw was some woman dressed up as Lucille Ball (in turn 
playing Lucy Ricardo) trying to get in and get autographs.
to the studio</p>
<p>each tape date, one week's worth of episodes are recorded in 
two sessions. The morning session is Monday &ndash; Wednesday; 
the afternoon is Thursday and Friday (this is true for other 
shows, too). The nine of us taping in the morning (plus the 
alternate) were picked up in a bus and brought to the Sony 
Pictures Studio where the show is filmed. We were taken to 
the green room, where there were snacks galore! We also 
met again with the casting team and some producers to go 
over some final legal business (mostly standards and practices 
stuff). We then went on a tour of the set, checking out the 
video wall, Alex's podium, and the contestant lecterns. Just 
like the hotel swimming pool, the set is much smaller than 
it looks on television. Fact: At the bottom of Alex's podium, 
there was a ball that looks like it's made of marble, but it was 
actually made of cardboard. I learned this by giving it a little 
kick and then being chastised.</p>
making a mockery of it
<p>We also played a mock game in order to get used to playing in 
the studio. The first players up (myself included) got to sign 
their names in and played the first half of a Jeopardy game 
with a contestant coordinator as the host. This gives you a 
fifteen clue chance to get used to the timing of the lockout 
system, picking clues off the board, and looking at the score 
readout. I explicitly remember a Comic Strip category in my 
part of the mock game, where you had to identify characters 
based on their pictures. I responded, "Who are Sally Brown 
and Linus van Pelt?" to one clue, and the producers seemed 
surprised that someone would add in their last names. everyone else had a go, too, finishing up the game. We were then 
seated together on one side off the audience, away from our 
families (no cheating!) and told that we wouldn't learn who 
our opponents would be until right before our games.</p>
from the sidelines
<p>They picked the first three contestants, and I wasn't one of 
them, so I stayed in the stands with the other kids. The first 
three contestants disappeared back to the green room, and 
the regular audience came out and filled in the studio. When 
taping began, Alex &amp; Johnny were there, live &amp; in person. It's 
difficult to watch it all at once in person &mdash; you've got the clues, 
which are shown to the audience on monitors on the sides of 
the set, as well as Alex and the contestants to watch. It's right 
nice having it edited down when you watch it on TV! At commercial breaks, which are really taken to give everyone a little 
break in the action (water, bathroom, and the judges can review rulings) the contestants were quickly moved to directortype chairs on the set and had their make-up touched up. Alex 
would come answer questions from the audience. I can't stress 
the following enough: <i>Alex Trebek is a smart, nice, funny and 
humble guy.</i> (or at least he was with us kids around.) We 
also played along in the audience &mdash; they read you the riot 
act about not shouting out answers (S&amp;P again), but people 
were clearly whispering the correct responses &mdash; and not just 
us kids. They told us to stop once or twice, but didn't seem to 
really mind, because on stage, it's hard to hear the audience. 
We also found out that the second &amp; third place parting gifts 
would be be computers, and that everyone &mdash; including the 
winners &mdash; would receive trips to Universal Studios orlando. 
I was twelve &mdash; this was exciting! And in the blink of an eye, 
Monday's game was done.</p>
my turn
<p>They announced the second game's players &mdash; and I was included! We were off in a flash to have make-up done in the 
green room and to get ready to go on. Then everything was 
just like you saw it one YouTube. Almost. I'd like to share 
some things that you don't see at home that we see in the studio, as well as what was going through my mind while playing 
&mdash; spoilers ahead!</p>
contestant's cut
<p>Right out the gate, I was having a hard time ringing in. 
When you play along at home (make sure to follow the rules 
to watching Jeopardy with other people!), you can respond to 
every question you like. on the program, you are up against 
two really smart people &mdash; my game was no exception. As a 
general rule, all three contestants know the answer to the first 
three clues in most categories. (The exceptions tend to be the 
arts and sport.) This means that you are fighting via buzzer 
alone against two contestants for more than half of the game. 
This gets really frustrating really fast.</p>
<p>In the commercial breaks, we shot "Hometown Howdies" 
to be aired on our local stations and took pictures with Alex &mdash; 
for promos and for keepsakes. Yes, I have a <i>Jeopardy!</i> picture 
frame.</p>
<p>Three clues stand out in my mind in this game. First is the 
clue delivered by Bill nye, which involved the worst Schwarzenegger impression I've ever seen. It's no wonder none of us 
came up with the correct response of "What's the terminator?" Two other clues were things that I had actually discussed 
with my parents in the days preceding the show. In order to 
get to LA, we flew over Roswell, a correct response. Mom had 
also mentioned Prince William's birthday, and I had been all, 
"Who cares?" I should've.</p>
<p>For Final, you are given as much time as you like to make 
your wager; they even gave us pen and paper in case we needed it. I didn't &mdash; it was a moment of ballsiness and the knowledge that if you don't come in first, you don't keep your cash.</p>
the end<font size="-2">?</font>
<p>Again, as quickly as it had started, it was over. I hardly remember the third game. When the second batch of kids arrived, we all took a photo together with Alex in front of the 
video wall. We also all got <i>Jeopardy!</i> prize packs (a copy of the 
home game &amp; the like) that had also been awarded to audience members as door prizes. We headed back to the hotel, 
and that was that. There was a little sightseeing that evening 
(we ran into a girl from the first episode taped), but other 
than that, nothing crazy. It was a lot of fun, but it goes by 
really fast!</p>

<h3>screenwriting</h3>
<b><h2>How do screenwriters feel about 
bad reviews, in particular claims of 
formulaic writing?</h2>
<p>Sean Hood, Professional screenwriter and director (See 
wikipedia or IMDB). Graduate of USC's School of Cinematic Arts, and currently an instructor there.</p></b>
<p>Critics, being writers themselves, love to target the screenwriter when they write vicious reviews. I know that the original spec script for "Bad Teacher" was extremely well-received 
by readers, agents, and executives across Hollywood, but I can 
guarantee that Anthony Lane did not read that spec script 
and is basing his pan of the script on what he saw on screen. 
This can be very frustrating for the writer if s/he had much 
of their original script changed during production and post.</p>
<p>(For example, my brother, Brendan Hood, has had scathing reviews for a horror movie he wrote called <i>They</i>. Although 
he got sole credit for the film, <i>every single word was rewritten 
by a team of subsequent writers, producers, and even PA's on 
set</i>. The result was that he got called a "talentless screenwriter," based on a film that he actually didn't write.)</p>
<p>Though I am an avid reader of the new Yorker, I think 
Anthony Lane is an annoying critic. every review of a Hollywood film he writes can be summarized as follows: <i>Here are 
all the numerous ways that I, Anthony Lane, am so, so, SO 
much more clever and sophisticated than the movie I am reviewing and the people who made it.</i></p>
<p>What is frustrating for screenwriters and movie fans is 
not that this isn't true. Anthony Lane IS far more clever and 
sophisticated than the movies he reviews. But, why the hell 
is he reviewing "Bad Teacher" in the first place? Is it any surprise that "Bad Teacher" doesn't have a title worthy of Raymond Chandler? or that some of the scenes are derivative 
and that these scenes are not as well executed as those in classics like "Cool Hand Luke?" </p>
<p>From a screenwriter and filmmaker's perspective, this 
kind of review is lazy and self-indulgent. "Bad Teacher" will 
be reviewed by tens of thousands of people on the internet, 
and no reader of the new Yorker needs Mr. Lane to trash it, 
except to participate in intellectual and cinematic snobbery.</p>
<p>What Anthony Lane does well is find smaller films, independent and foreign films, like &ldquo;The names of Love,&rdquo; which 
he buries later in the article. This is the kind of movie that has 
no advertising budget, but is perfect for readers of the new 
Yorker, who may be interested in seeing a film with higher 
creative ambitions than "Bad Teacher." I think most screenwriters wish that professional critics would focus on finding 
these hidden gems, and use their platform to help them get 
seen. By highlighting mainstream films in reviews that do 
little more than state the obvious and blame the screenwriter, 
critics like Anthony Lane only make it harder for filmmakers 
and screenwriters to get quality scripts made. </p>
As for myself, I have suffered numerous "bad reviews" for 
movies I've had my name on. For example: 
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Halloween: Resurrection </b>&mdash; "Screenwriters Larry Brand 
and Sean Hood churn out the cliches with such lifeless 
predictability you can practically hear the cogs grinding."</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>The Crow: Wicked Prayer</b> &mdash; "It is just like the first one 
&mdash; if the first one had been written by a room full of meanspirited six-year-olds with a finger-paint budget of $12.00."</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Fear Itself: Echoes </b>&mdash; "This entire episode must have extremely easy on the lazy screenwriter Sean Hood (whose 
previous credits include various installments of the Halloween, Cube, and The Crow franchises, plus an uncredited rewrite on Cursed, which, as one of the saddest werewolf movies in recent memory, hardly endears him to me) 
since all he had to do was write half of it and then copy and 
paste whole scenes and lines of dialogue and just change 
the character names . . . his writing has so little ambition 
behind it, it's sad."</p>
<p>Again, what's really frustrating for me, and many screenwriters, when we get reviews like this is that, from the point of 
view of the finished product, they are accurate. Those three 
projects turned out every bit as badly as the reviewers described. </p>
<p>one wants to say, "But it was better in the script!" or say 
"They didn't shoot what I wrote!" or "I was just the script doctor! It's not my fault." But ultimately, as part of the "creative 
team" responsible for those turkeys, I have grin and bear it.</p>
<p>For my most recent film, Conan the Barbarian, I got some 
of the most deliciously bad reviews of my screenwriting career. </p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
"The few good elements are dwarfed by a generic, nonsensical plot and shoddy storytelling."
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
"non-stop blood-and-guts action aimed at game boys and 
emotionally stunted lovers of adolescent fantasy . . . There 
is no purpose to the film other than random blood splattering amid scenes of bondage, primitive savagery and 
S&amp;M eroticism. It is empty of story or character."</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
"The very fact no attempt is made to hide the over-acted 
performances and under-developed storyline will sit perfectly fine with fans of this kind of junk." (on Rotten Tomatoes, that was one of the "positive" reviews.)</p>
So how do I "feel" about having worked on one of the most 
critically ridiculed movies of the year? 
<p>I had enormous fun working on Conan, and I've got a very 
thick skin. I'm confident enough in my own work to know 
that I write well, and I've accepted the fact that the filmmaking process is collaborative, frustrating, and often unfair: setting up the screenwriter to take the fall. That's okay. I can 
take the heat. It's worth it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I get hired again and again to write movies 
based on the screenplays I've written that have gone unproduced. These scripts often get rave "reviews" from the executives and producers who read them, along with condolences, 
"too bad that didn't get made. It's just fantastic, but female 
leads, dramas and period films are just hard. They don't make 
their money back. But, we love your writing and we'd like to 
hire you to write Children of The Corn Part 36."</p>
<p>I have no delusions that I'm a screenwriting genius. I'm 
a "genre hack" (as chronicled in my blog genrehacks.com) 
and I'm an artsy, eccentric indie filmmaker. But when given 
the opportunity, I write well-structured stories with complex 
characters who make surprising choices. What "bad reviews" 
remind me of, is that in Hollywood, I rarely get the opportunity. </p>
<p>To snarky and clever professional reviews, I say stop shooting fish in a barrel, and go find well-written, but smaller, films 
and direct people to see them. To jaded, cynical fan boys, I 
say stop rewarding "formulaic" films by buying tickets to see 
them, and ignoring films that are far better. Search out and 
find those ambitious and well-written movies that may not 
have a big star or swollen digital effects budget. </p>
<p>Screenwriters want to get original, ambitious, and entertaining movies up on the screen. Help us do that! This is what 
I think about when I get bad reviews.</p>
<p>P.S. I can't imagine that Mr. Lane, himself read this, but 
I was pleased that on a week in which he could have trashed 
Conan, Spy Kids, or Fright night, he chose to highlight the 
intriguing smaller film "Higher Ground." Let's hope he sticks 
to that pattern, and meanwhile I will daydream about a day 
I get to make more little movies more like this one: http://

<h3>movie making</h3>
<b><h2>What determines whether an actor 
is cast in a part in Hollywood?</h2>
Ashton Kutcher, I'm an actor and producer of film and TV</b>
Talent, experience, relationships, directors, awards, and financial risk reduction.
<p>Talent is subjective (after all, I've been accused by some 
of having very little) but you have to have some level of showmanship. That being said, some of the best actors I know have 
a hard time finding work.</p>
<p>experience is key. Back ground in theater, improv troops, 
and formal training is very helpful. The director and studio 
want to know you you have a history of showing up and being 
good. </p>
<p>Relationships - Film making is a collaboration, and we 
all enjoy working with people we know and like. Catching 
a break is often times built on someone that knows you and 
believes in you giving you a shot. </p>
<p>Directors are key. The top directors in the business call the 
shots when it comes to casting. They either see you in the part 
or they don't. one shot with the right director in the right 
film can launch somebody. Agents sell hard based on whom 
you've worked with.</p>
<p>Awards - one role with recognition can be all it takes.
Finance - At the end of the day, it's show BUSIneSS. 
every studio has a list of actors based on Historical box office, domestic and foreign. Generally, they are trying to hedge 
their financial investment. There is a common model that is 
used where the studio or financier presell packages in foreign 
territories based on talent commitments. The more production budget they can offset the more confident they feel about 
moving forward. This is why some people who may not appear 
to be big stars in the states continue to work. They have big 
foreign value. It's all about B.o. HITS. You can be in a PoS 
flick but if it makes money, you continue to work.</p>

<h2>PoLITICS</h2>
<h3>u.s. presidential elections</h3>
<b><h2>How early do politicians and 
presidential political campaigns 
begin quietly promising/planning 
cabinet seats and vice president 
positions?</h2>
<p>Jennifer Miller, Field Staffer, Vice Presidential Selection 
researcher, PA Deputy Press Secretary, Bill Clinton and 
Clinton/Gore (1992); NH Press Secretary, Clinton/Gore 
(1996); Vice Presidential Selection, Al Gore (2000); Senior 
Advisor to the Deputy Chair, Democratic National Committee (2000)</p></b>
A few subjective thoughts, then my personal experiences:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 The percentage of time a presidential candidate spends 
planning his/her DC fantasy team is likely inversely proportionate to the odds of him/her ever having the opportunity to make those nominations.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
At least in modern times, candidates do not promise the 
VP nomination, BUT that does not mean that wannabe 
Veeps never HeAR a promise amid effusive praise soliciting their loyalty. (With her tenuous grasp of facts, can't 
you imagine Michele Bachmann interpreting that she's 
been promised the slot?)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
It is likely that candidates (or their top aides) make vague 
overtures about (former) rivals serving in Cabinet-level 
posts, without committing to anything.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Consideration is easier process-wise when a potential VP 
nominee has been a primary rival: the campaign already 
has amassed meticulous opposition research files. Likewise, when short-listed for VP, statewide officials usually 
turn over similarly cataloged materials about <i>themselves, </i>
which would have been compiled to predict and combat 
negative campaigns at home.</p>
<p>In 1992, Bill Clinton's VP selection team formed in early May, 
about two months before his July 9 announcement with Al 
Gore (which came only a couple days after the formal ask, and 
one week before the Democratic national Convention). The 
process had several stages:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Clinton publicly named three experienced leaders (Warren Christopher, Vernon Jordan, and Madeline Kunin) 
who oversaw the process, fielded input, and consulted with 
people who had advised previous Democratic nominees.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
When our research group first met, we received a pretty long list of potential nominees. At least half a dozen 
names came with assignments to write a five or six page 
memo, and the rest started with one or two page memos. 
(As the youngest person and only non-attorney, I did not 
write any of the the long memos, and mostly conducted 
research as assigned by other full-time team members.) </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
over the following weeks, names were added and deleted, and some moved up from the lower tier. Higher tier 
names called for deeper research from Lexis-nexis (dialup) and the Library of Congress. It was 1992.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 once there was a serious short list, non-staff teams of 
attorneys joined the vetting process &mdash; interviews in the 
field, scanning of every document imaginable (including 
medical records), analysis of every public writing, and finally a one-on-one interview with Clinton.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
At least one potential short-lister declined consideration 
(and vetting), though we continued with some odd public 
record review in case the decision changed. At least one 
person wrongly told the press s/he was on the "short list," 
and we held interviews in the field out of respect.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
our team had no leaks. To this day, I have never read a 
book or news article that got all of the facts right.
<p>Two days after the general election (that is, Thursday, november 5), President-elect Clinton named Christopher and 
Jordan the heads of his transition team. They soon assigned 
the same group of us to Cabinet Selection, with two wonderful new leaders and a team which rapidly expanded. This 
time, I led a handful of non-lawyer researchers, managed the 
data and assignments, and organized the files and memos. I 
still have a copy of the (pre-WWW) research manual I created . . . and probably should not still have the all of the name 
tabs from the filing cabinet dividers. To answer the question 
more directly:</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> no Cabinet assignment was pre-determined. Multiple 
people were considered for every position.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Quite a few top White House positions and sub-Cabinet 
nominations were considered in the same process, and the 
same batches of memos.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Soon-to-be Secretary of State Christopher did not know 
we were preparing materials about him until they were 
ready to go to President-elect Clinton (Thanksgiving 
weekend 1992). nothing had been promised to him.</p>
<p>I worked on VP selection again in 2000, secretly and parttime while an associate at a DC law firm. (Yes, it killed my 
billable hours.) Unlike in 1992, there was no full-time research team, as Al Gore had more time to make a decision 
&mdash; the process began slowly in April 2000, and the Democratic 
national Convention did not take place until August. Many 
of the same people were involved as in 1992 (including selection process head Christopher and some of the short-list vetting team attorneys). </p>
<p>Some of my most memorable life experiences and important personal relationships developed because of how seriously most potential presidents take decisions about running 
mates and Cabinet members.</p>
<p>That said, I cannot fathom how the McCain team approached VP selection in 2008. If they had a similar process 
in place, it must have been pushed aside by pressure from 
pollsters and political advisers. The Sarah Palin record/family/temperament surprises would have been known internally, 
and removed her from consideration when viewed as a complete picture.</p>

<h3>air force one</h3>
<b><h2>What's it like to fly on Air Force 
One?</h2>
Peter Marquez, Space policy geek.</b>
<p>It's awesome. I only got to fly on her once. <br/>
The staff is amazing, and after flying on AF1, you will <br/>
neVeR want to fly commercial again.<br/>
The experience starts before you even get on the plane. <br/>
You are transported from the White House to Andrews, and <br/>
you get to drive right up to the airplane and leave the vehicle <br/>
and walk up into the plane. (only the president and his close <br/>
staff get the Marine 1 transport to Andrews.)<br/>
It's very comfortable: huge seats, desks and tables for <br/>
working. A full conference room with flat screens and video <br/>
teleconferencing capability. There's a computer room with Internet access. <br/>
one of the greatest things about AF1 has nothing to do <br/>
with the aircraft itself, it's the people that make AF1 run. All <br/>
of the AF1 staff appear to really enjoy their jobs, and they take <br/>
great pride in their work. It definitely appeared that none of <br/>
them took this great opportunity for granted. They are also <br/>
well-versed in the history of AF1 and can tell you stories about <br/>
all the previous AF1s.<br/>
The trip I was on was very short. We were flying from DC <br/>
to Kennedy Space Center for a speech President obama was <br/>
giving.<br/>
During the flight, I had been helping to work and rework <br/>
a speech the President was about to give. He kept coming <br/>
out of his cabin with more edits and changes. After another <br/>
round of edits from the boss, an attendant looked at me and <br/>
asked if I needed anything. I jokingly said, "Yes, a nice strong <br/>
drink. Preferably a single malt," (it was about nine or ten in <br/>
the morning). Without pausing the attendant asks, "What <br/>
brand and what year?" I had to tell him I was joking. 
In addition to my colleagues and a few members of Congress, we also had Buzz Aldrin on the flight. Dr. Aldrin was <br/>
seated next to me at our table and he starts to get a bit fidgety, he looks around, and he says, "You wanna go take a look <br/>
around?"<br/>
So I stop working for a minute and Dr. Aldrin and I start <br/>
checking out AF1. We make it over to the stairs that lead to <br/>
the upper deck and cockpit and one of the staff members asks <br/>
if we want to head upstairs and check out the cockpit. Dr. <br/>
Aldrin got a big smile on his face and looked at me. We were <br/>
both smiling like little kids. Did we want to see the cockpit of <br/>
AF1? Seriously? You have to ask?<br/>
So Dr. Aldrin and I make it up to the flight deck and all <br/>
of the Air Force officers are in awe of this moon walker and <br/>
here's Buzz Aldrin happy as a little kid because he's hanging <br/>
out in the cockpit of AF1. Dr. Aldrin goes into the cockpit, <br/>
and I stand outside of it with my head sticking through the <br/>
doorway. So here I am, essentially a nobody and I'm hanging <br/>
out in the cockpit of AF1, with the pilots, while AF1 is in <br/>
flight, and I'm with Buzz Aldrin. Somewhere back in time, <br/>
the ten year old version of me was saying, "You have got to be <br/>
kidding  me . . . " <br/>
It was way too short of a flight. <br/>
But just a couple of more interesting bits. <br/>
First, as we started to descend, I instinctively went back to <br/>
my seat and buckled up. But I noticed a lot of the other "frequent flyers" were still up and walking around. So I asked one <br/>
of them, "When are we supposed to sit down?" They just kind <br/>
of laughed at my "noob question" and said something to the effect of "You don't really have to sit down at all, just watch how <br/>
the pilot lands this thing." So people were still up and walking <br/>
around as the plane landed. For someone who had only flown <br/>
commercial, it was a fascinating to me for some reason. Sure <br/>
enough, the pilot put her down like a feather and came to a <br/>
gentle stop.<br/>
Second, we landed on the space shuttle runway. Another <br/>
thing that blew my mind. of course we were going to an event <br/>
at Kennedy Space Center so the closest runway is the space <br/>
shuttle runway, but landing in AF1 on the space shuttle runway was more mind blowing then not having to sit down during landing. <br/>
Finally, you get a bill for the food you eat on AF1 (this may <br/>
be the only thing AF1 has in common with United). Since <br/>
you are eating a meal on AF1 you are doing so at taxpayer expense. This means you have to reimburse the government for <br/>
whatever you ate. That's completely fair and the right thing <br/>
to do but it's something you wouldn't immediately consider <br/>
when flying on AF1. So about a week after my AF1 flight, I <br/>
got a bill sent to me for the lunch I ate on AF1. That bill made <br/>
for a great souvenir.<br/>
So to paraphrase philosopher Ferris Bueller: "It is so <br/>
choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend . . . "
I forgot one more thing, if you make a phone call from <br/>
AF1, it's routed through a couple of operators who sit up on <br/>
the flight deck. They make the outgoing call for you, and then <br/>
they connect you to the person once they make the call. The <br/>
cool part is that when they call person for you they say something to the effect of (my memory is a bit fuzzy here), "This is <br/>
Air Force one, we have a call from &lt;whatever your name is&gt; <br/>
can you hold while I connect you?" I think just receiving a call <br/>
from AF1 would be amazing.</p>

positives
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Vietnam would not have happened for the U.S., as nixon 
would have continued the previous administrations policies that he was part of creating.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Watergate would not have happened because nixon 
would have been the standard barrier for the party. In the 
70s, Reagan was in the wings and things were changing, 
feeding his paranoia.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Perhaps connecting with China would have happened 
sooner, blunting some of the negative affects of China's 
rise because it would have been more staged.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I don't think the Bay of Pigs would have happened at all, 
but rather just a continuation of trying to engage Cuba 
while slowly isolating it, which nixon was instrumental 
in setting up in 1959.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Reagan becomes president in '68 instead of '80, thanks to 
Ford/nixon being out of the way. This makes his presidency drastically different due to a totally different set 
of circumstances and being in much better health with a 
much different group of people around him.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Goldwater never happens in '64.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Democrats don&rsquo;t have a credible chance to take the 
White House until '76, but likely have considerable power 
in Congress if not outright majorities led by the Kennedy's. Due to this, I think nixon, and later Reagan, move 
forward with robust legislation on Civil Rights because it 
brings the Democrats to the table on other issues.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Both Bobby and Jack Kennedy are never assassinated because they don't get into the position to be real targets 
during the turmoil of the era.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Bush dynasty is unlikely because if Reagan wins in 
'68 he likely picks a different VP, probably Rockefeller, to 
balance his ticket </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The Cold War ends sooner without all the proxy fights 
happening. I can see nixon and later Reagan using China 
as a proxy to kill the USSR either via military action or 
economic action.</p>

The Supreme Court looks radically different today.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
There is never the political will to overturn our banking

<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> Ford never becomes president, maybe Senator but not 
President.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Due to a likely second term for nixon, LBJ never becomes President either, as he would have been too ill in 
'68 to run.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
our history is drastically different after '76, to the point 
that it is unrecognizable. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
either Bobby or Ted Kennedy is elected president in '76

<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Ross Perot possibly becomes president as a Republican in

Jack Kennedy never becomes President and the country 
has to watch as he has to leave the Senate and die a horrible death from Addison's disease or complications from it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Marilyn Monroe never reaches the level of notoriety she 
had because there is no scandal with JFK and no "happy

Both Medicaid and HMo's never happen, likely resulting 
in us being a backwater of medical science.

 Though there are many gains for civil rights, the Black 
Power movement is crushed, resulting in those gains not 
really meaning anything to average folks for a long time.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
We probably never go to the moon, space, yes . . . moon, 
no.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Due to its more robust involvement in the Cold War, China rises and overshadows us faster, if not handled well, 
that could be very bad.</p>

Due to there being no Vietnam, we still have a draft that 
can be used at any time instead of the ghost of one that

<h3>u.s. immigration</h3>
<b><h2>Should highly skilled international 
students (including Bachelors, 
Masters, Doctorate) be given 
Green Cards?</h2>
Craig Montuori, Study it, live it, and love it.</b><br/>
The short answer is yes. Yes, we should grant more highlyskilled, highly-educated immigrants green cards.
<p>For purely selfish American reasons, the answer is yes. 
Highly skilled immigrants are productive, net-positive members of American society, just like highly skilled Americans. 
This country has a certain median production per capita, and 
anything that increases that median means more economic 
growth for America. More economic growth means more and 
better opportunities for native-born Americans.</p>
<p>Take Amit Aharoni as an example; Israeli-born, Stanford 
GSB-education, StartupChile alumnus. By november '11, 
through his company Cruisewise, he had created nine jobs 
held by Americans in San Francisco, had raised over $1.6M in 
funding. His visa rejected, Amit left for Canada, continuing 
to run his SF-based company from Vancouver via Skype. ABC 
picked up his story and boom, Amit got a visa. Amit's Cruisewise is now up to sixteen employees in SF as the company 
continues to grow and prosper.</p>
<p>I'll leave the pure statistics to folks like the Kauffman 
Foundation or Vivek Wadhwa, but this set of immigrants 
contribute much more to America than they consume. By 
partnering with Americans to found and grow jobs-creating 
companies, the country benefits from their success. With a 
single missing founder &mdash; like elon Musk of South Africa &mdash; 
PayPal might not have succeeded and grown into the success 
story it has.</p>
<p>Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook told a story last August 
about an extremely skilled developer from the UK. His visa 
application was denied, and since the developer was so talented, Facebook simply hired a team of ten in the UK to support 
him. The office those people worked in needed to be cleaned, 
it needed office supplies. All of that secondary spending and 
all of those jobs were a direct loss to the American economy 
because that one visa was rejected.</p>
<p>The question becomes who decides what highly skilled 
means. Current proposals range from simply stapling a green 
card to the diploma of any foreign graduate to only for technical (STeM) PhDs. Many VCs who are facilitators for the 
success of entrepreneurs and interested in growing a stronger 
entrepreneurial community have spoken out in support: </p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2010/06/mr-feld-goesto-dc-again-to-talk-about-innovation.html<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/06/the-chorus-for-immigration-reform-grows-louder.html
<p>Some actual bills have been proposed in the US Congress 
containing STeM Green Card provisions; most require that 
the graduate get a job in a technical field rather than explicitly spelling out a path where jobs creators can also qualify:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Startup Act (2.0), S.1965/S.3217<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
SMART Jobs Act, S.3192<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
STAR Act, S.3185<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
STAPLe Act, H.R.399</p>
<p>other proposals, like Startup Visa, require more initiative &mdash; 
separate from but usually correlated with higher education 
&mdash; to create something economically valuable to the country 
in order to qualify for the visa and convert it to a green card.</p>
<p>Whether through academic research, industrial manufacturing, or entrepreneurial disruption, these are the people 
who will work with highly-skilled, driven Americans to help 
create the future. There is no cap to success in a world where 
we acknowledge that we can grow the economic pie; more 
ingredients simply leads to more success.</p>
<p>And I'm a selfish guy. I want that success to be American; 
no matter her country of birth, if she's building the future, I 
want it to be built here.</p>

exactly how I have felt and still feel about murdering someone 
is an understatement. </p>
<p>I guess the beginning would be the best place to start. 
When I took another man&rsquo;s life, I was just nineteen years 
old. Looking back now, I can honestly say I felt immense peer 
pressure to go through with the murder. I felt like I would 
be seen as a weak punk if I let another man get over on me. 
I was a drug dealer, and I felt I had a reputation to uphold. I 
can see all this now, but at the time I could see none of this. I 
realize now I was in a very bad place in life back then. I was 
in the midst of a serious drug addiction. I felt worthless and 
unworthy of love, so in return, I placed little value on my life 
or on the life of anyone else. All of these feelings combined, 
made feel so powerless in life, I lashed out.</p>
<p>My lashing out cost another human his life. I am ashamed 
to admit it, but at the time I felt a great weight was lifted off
my shoulders when I pulled the trigger. I felt like I had finally 
stood up for myself. I was completely irrational. I realize now 
it is like my friend David Monroe always says, &ldquo;Hurt people 
hurt people.&rdquo; I was really hurting, and I didn&rsquo;t know how to 
ask for help.</p>
<p>I continued to justify my actions for a long time, but somewhere deep inside, I have always known that there was never 
any justice in taking someone&rsquo;s life. Admitting to myself I was 
feeling scared, lonely, unworthy of love and respect was just 
too hard. Also, by admitting these feelings of mine, I would 
also have to come to grips with what I really did, and how I 
affected the world. This was a hard prospect for me, but I am 
finally there over fifteen years later.</p>
<p>now I feel sadness over murdering someone. I feel I have 
robbed my victim&rsquo;s family of the most precious thing in life. I 
feel immense sorrow for this. I feel I have robbed my family 
out of truly ever knowing me. I feel like I have inspired fear 
in my community. I feel that I have done the world a great 
disservice, and that I owe a debt that I can never fully repay. I 
am full of guilt and shame over my actions.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, deciding to murder someone was the 
worst mistake of my life. I don&rsquo;t believe I even possess the 
right words to fully express how it feels to murder someone, 
but I can say, I never want anyone else to feel the way I do.</p>

<b><h2>Do inmates in San Quentin have 
access to computers and the 
Internet? What kind of access?</h2>
James Houston, inmate San Quentin</b>
<p>I came to prison when Motorola&rsquo;s first flip phone was the 
phone to have. People still depended on land lines, and you 
could find a phone booth with no trouble. As you know, things 
have changed since then.</p>
<p>I remember laughing at a guy for burning some bologna 
in a microwave until I found out he had been incarcerated 
twenty years, and it was his first time using one. I have never 
been on the internet although I hear there is something for everyone on the internet. In San Quentin for an inmate, there is 
no legal access to the internet. If you work as a clerk, you can 
work on a computer for job related purposes. In the library, 
there are three computers designated for inmates to practice our typing skills. We can&rsquo;t print anything out, though. 
Then there are about five more computers for researching legal issues. These computers don&rsquo;t have internet access. The 
computers inmates are allowed to use are basically modern 
typewriters when it comes to what you can do on them. Then 
think about eight computers in a library that serves a population of around 2,500 men.</p>
<p>Most people can&rsquo;t imagine life without the internet or 
their mobile phones. I am trying to imagine life with them 
where I can send real-time messages, photos, my resume, and 
job applications. Thinking about all I have to learn can be 
overwhelming at times. Hopefully in the near future, this issue will be addressed. I think becoming computer literate can 
help lower the recidivism rate.</p>

<b><h2>What does the first day of a 5+ year 
prison sentence feel like?</h2>
Kenyatta Leal, inmate San Quentin State Prison</b>
<p>I remember my first day because it was my worst day. I was 
sentenced to life in prison on September 25, 1995, and about 
a week later was transferred from the San Diego County Jail 
to RJ Donovan Prison for intake into the state prison system. The morning of my transfer, a deputy came to my cell 
and told me that I was &ldquo;catching the chain&rdquo; to the pen. I 
had just made it to sleep as my cellmate and I had stayed 
up late playing chess and talking. He was a nineteen-year-old 
first-termer headed to the joint with a life sentence, and every 
night he would ask me a gang of questions about prison life. 
I felt compelled to answer his questions in as much detail as 
possible, because I knew he didn't understand the danger he 
was headed into and he needed all the help he could get.</p>
<p>As I got myself together, my cellmate sat up on his bunk, 
wrapped his arms around his knees and watched me like a 
child would watch a parent. My heart went out to the little 
dude because he needed more guidance that I ever could give 
him. I started to remind him of some of the things we had 
talked about, but the deputy came back to get me. He told me 
to state my name and booking number, then turn around and 
cuff up. I complied and when I turned back around to cuff up, 
my cellmate was sitting there crying. I will never forget that 
look of hopelessness on his face, and I can only imagine the 
look on mine. I told him to keep his head up, and I walked 
down the stairs with the deputy. Right then I said a prayer for 
that kid, because as bad as my situation was, he was someone 
who had it far worse than me.</p>
<p>We got to the holding cell and there were about twenty 
others waiting to catch the chain also. They call it catching 
the chain because we're all chained together as we go to the 
pen. The single file chain of men made its way outside, and it 
felt good to walk around a bit and breathe in that crisp morning air. As we loaded onto the bus, the deputies unchained 
us from each other, but we were left shackled at the waist 
and ankles. no one said a word on the bus, and my heart was 
beating so hard I could hear it. The ride to Donovan took all 
of twenty minutes as the prison is literally within eye sight of 
the county facility from which I was transferred. The sun was 
just coming up as we pulled into R&amp;R (Receiving &amp; Release) 
at Donovan. </p>
<p>I couldn't wait to get out of those handcuffs and leg irons; 
being shackled up like that is something I could never get 
used to. As soon as we walked into R&amp;R, I saw someone I 
knew from the county jail and he was all smiles as he asked 
me how much time I had. When I told him twenty-five years 
to life, his eyes got big and he took a step back, as if I had 
some kind of virus he didn't want to catch. His response surprised me. First it made me feel nervous, then worried that 
everyone else would respond to me the same way. He didn't 
know what to say and neither did I. I tried to ease the awkwardness of the moment with small talk about my appeal but 
no matter what I said, I couldn't escape the growing despair 
in my gut; and that was only the first day.</p>
<p>We made it out of R&amp;R around noon and got back on 
the bus to go to &ldquo;four yard.&rdquo; We pulled up next to building 
16 and unloaded straight into the dayroom. once inside, we 
walked into a gauntlet of correctional officers who immediately started yelling and telling us to shut the f*** up and not 
ask them for anything because we had nothing coming. After 
an intense thirty minutes, we all had to sit and wait to be interviewed by the gang coordinator. While we waited, I heard 
familiar voices of people I knew who had caught the chain 
before me, asking if I needed anything. At that point, I was 
so depressed and downtrodden that I didn&rsquo;t respond verbally. 
I just shook my head.</p>
<p>After my interview, I walked upstairs to the cell where 
I&rsquo;d spend the rest of the first day of a life sentence. I stepped 
inside and the sound of the cold steel door slamming behind 
me ricocheted around inside my skull, making me dizzy. I 
just stood there in shock. I remember wanting to scream but 
when I opened my mouth nothing but sobs came out. I was 
devastated. I heard people calling my name on the tier but I 
couldn&rsquo;t speak. I closed my eyes hoping to find some relief, but 
what I saw in my mind&rsquo;s eye were all of the horrible choices 
I made and the faces of the people that I hurt in the process. 
I thought about the times when I coulda, woulda, shoulda 
taken action to stop this nightmare from happening, but it 
was way too late. </p>
<p>Looking back, it was as if I was on a runaway train to 
prison, and every choice I made accelerated my imminent arrival. When I finally opened my eyes and looked around the 
filthy cell, there was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. I 
felt like the most worthless piece of crap ever known to mankind. My life had just hit rock bottom and I couldn&rsquo;t see any 
way up or out. That was by far the worst moment of the worst 
day of my entire life.</p>

<b><h2>What did it feel like when the gavel 
dropped in court with the verdict 
and how have you changed your life 
behind bars since then?</h2>
David Monroe, inmate San Quentin</b>
<p>So often, we waste our time trying to get even with those who 
have hurt us in some way, completely ignoring those who have 
helped us in some way. I had made this mistake so many times 
in my life that it became a normal function. I became so consumed by the negative things in my life that I disregarded 
anything positive. All I could think about was that I was poor, 
hurt, and didn&rsquo;t have a father. I forgot that I was smart, loved, 
and still had a mother.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this until I was sitting in juvenile court 
waiting to hear whether or not I would be tried as an adult for 
murder. With my mother sitting behind me in the courtroom, 
I was shackled and forced to look straight ahead. I wanted so 
bad to look back and tell her that I loved her. They wouldn&rsquo;t 
let me. Reality started setting in that everything I had done 
was not just affecting me, but my family as well. Then the 
judge said, &ldquo;Mr. Monroe, you are a cold-blooded murderer 
and have no remorse for human life. For that reason, I am 
trying you as an adult and sending you to prison for the rest 
of your life.&rdquo; My whole body went numb and I felt paralyzed 
with fear as the words vibrated off my eardrum. As horrific as 
these words were to me, the most terrifying thing I have ever 
heard in my life was not words at all. It was the scream that 
came out of my mother&rsquo;s mouth when she realized that she 
had lost her son.</p>
<p>I had spent my childhood convincing myself that my life 
was &ldquo;f--- up&rdquo; and that no one loved me. Yes, my life wasn&rsquo;t 
the best, but that scream came from her soul. That scream 
told me that she loved me so much that she would never be 
the same without me. That scream told me that I was loved 
and cared about more than I could ever know. That scream 
changed my life.</p>
<p>I knew that I had to change the things I was doing, my 
attitude, and the way I viewed things. This was not an easy 
thing to do! I was only fifteen years old and still very immature. nevertheless, the seed was planted! I once read &ldquo;The 
only people to get even with are those who&rsquo;ve helped you.&rdquo; So 
despite all of the bad things in my life, for once I was going 
to get even with someone who was there for me and loved me 
unconditionally . . . my mom. There is no greater feeling in the 
world than making someone you love and care about proud 
of you! While I will never forget the terrifying sound of her 
scream, hearing her tell me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you son,&rdquo; has 
only motivated me to keep growing and doing amazing things 
despite my circumstances. And trust me, this place is full of 
people who will get on your nerves, push your buttons, and 
tempt you to throw all of your hard work away. But none of 
them are more important than me going home to my family 
and being free.</p>
<p>It is extremely hard for me to write about stuff like this 
because it means that I have to relive the pain and fear all 
over again. However, I do it so that just one of you may reflect 
on and rethink the direction of your life or the things you may 
be doing so that you don&rsquo;t have to make the same mistakes. 
I ask you, are ten negative things more important than one 
positive? Are ten haters more important than one friend or 
family member that loves and supports you?</p>

<h3>olympic games</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be an Olympic 
athlete after winning (or not 
winning) the Olympics?</h2>
Peter Cipollone, 2004 champ.</b>
<p>I competed in rowing as the coxswain of the USA men's eightoared crew in Sydney (2000) and Athens (2004). Because 
rowing is held during the first week of the Games, rowers 
have the entire second week to experience the fun part of the 
olympics. Having a medal, or not, makes a big difference in 
how that goes.</p>
<p>In 2000, we were heavily favored to win. We imploded and 
finished 5th. That second week was very difficult. We were 
like ghosts haunting the greatest celebration of amateur sport 
on earth. We would go to parties &mdash; at least the ones where we 
could get in &mdash; and watch what seemed like absolutely everyone else having the time of their lives. We quietly wondered 
what might have been. We slept a lot and scrapped for tickets 
to other events. Grown men cried.</p>
<p>That was the worst moment of my sports career. For years 
afterward, our meltdown in Sydney was the the last thing I 
thought about before I fell asleep and the first thing on my 
mind when I got up. Thinking about it now still stings. My 
teammates are also my closest friends. For some, that was 
their last chance. We will never get that back, and we all live 
with it every day.</p>
<p>In 2004, we were a dark horse, but by then, my mindset on 
racing had changed quite a bit. I wanted to finish my career 
with a personal best performance. If I could do that, the medal would take care of itself. In our medal race, we absolutely 
nailed it and won the gold.</p>
<p>From the moment we crossed the finish line, the difference between Athens and Sydney could not have been more 
stark. We had just achieved the dream of our youth, accompanied by all the expected things: going to the medal stand, 
seeing our flag go up, singing our national anthem, fighting 
back a tear or two, celebrating with our families and friends, 
getting back to our house and finding 200 emails waiting with 
subjects like, "ConGRATULATIonS!!!!!" and "oMG", even 
though it was not yet 6 am back home.</p>
<p>And then the second week began. nBC called. They wanted us on the Today Show. They liked us and invited us back 
later in the week. The Wall Street Journal asked if I would 
write an article about the experience. We did a top-ten list 
for Letterman. While we were waiting for the cameramen, 
wrestler Rulon Gardner picked me up with one hand.</p>
<p>We did not even need to be on the lists for parties. We 
skipped the line and flashed our medals at the door. Huge entourage wants to come in, too? no problem. Feel like jumping 
up on the stage with the band? Do it! Stage dive the crowd? 
That's cool, too. Global sponsors called to ask if we might attend a breakfast and answer a few questions for a fat honorarium. With pleasure. We were just getting back from a 
party somewhere and breakfast with people genuinely excited 
about the olympics sounded fun.</p>
<p>everywhere we went, it was a celebration. An official who 
looked quite like me introduced himself with stories of how 
random people were congratulating him and asking for his 
autograph. We got a picture together with him wearing the 
medal. People on the street would stop us and ask if their 
children could see the medal. That was the best.</p>
<p>With two days to go, I stopped sleeping. I had total fear 
of missing out. I visited with my friends from other countries. 
Who knew if we would ever see one another again? We just 
tried to experience as much of it as possible. We were not 
ghosts anymore.</p>
In the years since Athens, that medal has changed my life 
in ways too numerous to count. And they are all good.

<b><h2>Do Olympic or competitive 
swimmers ever pee in the pool?</h2>
Carly Geehr, former USA Swimming National Team Member<br/>
Disclaimer:</b> This is about to get into TMI territory, but hey, 
<p>I'm just answering the question . . .<br/>
nearly 100% of elite competitive swimmers pee in the <br/>
pool. Regularly. Some deny it, some proudly embrace it, but <br/>
everyone does.<br/>
The more interesting question is *when* does said peeing <br/>
happen?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Just about the only time you can get away with peeing 
during a race is during a breaststroke pullout. You spend 
enough time gliding that if you really gotta go, you probably could. otherwise, you're too tense and too, well, busy 
to even think about peeing.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Before a race is an interesting time. It depends on the 
meet and to some extent the color of the pool deck. I kid 
you not. You always try to pee before you swim, but sometimes your body defies logic and finds a way to refill your 
bladder just to spite you. Adrenaline and nerves wreak 
havoc on your system, and I knew tons of other swimmers 
that always, regardless of prior planning, had to pee right 
before a race. What to do if you're desperate? Well, it's not 
uncommon to splash yourself before you climb up on the 
blocks, so that extra liquid on yourself and the pool deck 
affords you an interesting opportunity. (I'll let you finish 
the rest of that thought.)</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Warmup/practice - totally free reign. As a swimmer, you 
just have to accept that you're swimming in pee. I had 
a teammate that would sit on the wall and announce 
"I'm  peeing!"  which  was . . .
disgusting . . .
but  at  least  she 
warned us. I'm sure I've swum directly behind people who 
were just letting it all out.</p>
<p>As to the underwater cameras catching it &mdash; even if olympic 
swimmers peed during their races, which they don't &mdash; there's 
just no way. The only way you can really tell if someone's peeing in the pool is if they announce it to you or they're really 
dehydrated/sitting in one spot while they go. It diffuses pretty 
quickly, and if you're moving, it diffuses even faster. (never 
been in a pool where they use those chemicals that makes pee 
turn bright colors, but have always wondered . . . )</p>

<h3>nBa season 2012&ndash;13</h3>
<b><h2>Why is Jeremy Lin so turnoverprone and how can he fix this?</h2>
Daryl Morey, GM Houston Rockets</b>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Many of Jeremy's turnovers are charges. These are the 
best turnovers to have, as not only do charges mean that 
you are being aggressive as a player (when good things 
often happen), but also turnover charges are not "live ball" 
turnovers where teams get a higher expected value possession the other way. For example, in our opening Detroit 
game, Jeremy had no "bad pass" turnovers. They were all 
charges or off the dribble. Compare his lack of any bad 
pass turnovers to his twelve "high quality" passes in the 
game (passes he made that set up high percentage offense 
for others).<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
This leads into my next point, which is that Jeremy's passes were the best in the league last year in the percentage 
that led to high quality offense. This is a fancy way of saying that when he makes a risky pass, it is usually for a high 
reward, so his bad pass turnovers, when he has them, are 
not as bad as for other guards, as his average possession 
efficiency remains higher.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Finally, most young guards who are going to be very good 
start as high turnover players in college and in their early 
seasons in the pros and get better throughout their career.</p>

<h3>Jeremy lin</h3>
<b><h2>What's it like to play on the same 
basketball team as Jeremy Lin?</h2>
Drew Housman, Guard, Harvard Basketball, Class of 2009</b>
<p>Up until about halfway through the 08-09 season, it was like 
having any other teammate. Then we played BC a few days 
after they had upset north Carolina, the number one team 
in the country at the time. no one thought we had a chance. 
The only other time I played BC was my freshman year, and 
we got blasted by 30.</p>
<p>We showed up at BC feeling confident as a team, but I 
think Jeremy was feeling a little something extra. He torched 
them from start to finish. It felt like he stole every pass and hit 
every jumper. They simply had no answer for him. The team 
played well as a whole, but Jeremy was clearly the reason we 
won the game. We were chanting his name on the shuttle ride 
home, never imagining that a sold out Madison Square Garden would be doing the same thing a few years later.</p>
<p>He had been the best player on our team for a while, but 
that game was the first time he showed that he could have 
been the best player on an ACC team. That is kind of amazing 
for an Ivy League guy.<br/>
overall, he is the best teammate you could ask for. Humble, works hard and plays hard. I can't say I'm that surprised 
to see what he is doing in the league. His ability to rise to the 
occasion is uncanny. He did it in high school, winning the 
state championship over the favored Mater Dei by making 
big plays in the 4th, he did it in college whenever he played a 
BCS school (except for Stanford his sophomore year, but that 
was a disaster across the board), and he is now doing it at the 
highest level possible. He might have a rough night against 
Columbia, but against UConn on national TV? 30 points in 
a near upset. It is really impressive when someone raises his 
level of play every time the pressure mounts.</p>
<p>Also, during the 4th quarter of the nets game, the announcer kept saying that Jeremy looked exhausted. What he 
doesn't know is that Jeremy always looks like that. He would 
appear to be dead tired after five minutes of warmups. no one 
really knew why, but no one really cared because he would 
always come out and put in work for forty minutes.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I have a distinct memory of the first real action he saw as 
a freshman. He found our big guy for a layup by throwing 
a no-look pass that I would never have attempted. His first 
year was rocky, but he showed flashes of potential.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
He became exceptional at elevating for his jump shot, noticing that the opposing bigs had turned their backs, and 
firing a pass to our big guy for a layup. It got to the point 
where opposing forwards would be more worried about 
that pass than getting into rebounding position.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
He is not "deceptively" quick like people keep saying. He 
is just super quick, straight up. And athleticism is not just 
about your bench press and your vertical. He has more 
than enough lateral quickness, coordination, body control, and instincts to make up for what he might lack in 
the more traditional athletic categories.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I was always more of a Madden guy, but from limited experience and word of mouth I gathered he was excellent 
at Halo.</p>

<h3>uefa euro 2012</h3>
<b><h2>What makes the Spanish national 
football team so dominant right 
now?</h2>
Hung Lee, Cultural Anthropologist &amp; Startup Recruiter</b>
They have invented a new way of playing the game.
<p>Tiki-taka isn't just a pleasing-to-the-eye brand of attacking football, it is so radical an evolution of the possession 
game that it's turned into a <i>revolutionary </i>way to play it. </p>
<p>Here are a few key concepts about this Spanish team that 
most commentators &mdash; at least english pundits &mdash; don't seem 
to understand. </p>
1. spain defends By keeping the Ball.
<p>The defensive statistics of this Spanish team are incredible &mdash; 
they conceded only one goal in euro 2012 and only a total of 
six across the last three major tournaments &mdash; that's nineteen 
tournament games in total. This is an unheard of achievement 
that even the most renowned defensive sides in history have 
not come close to. And yet Spain has very few genuinely destructive players, or even players whose primary role in the 
team is to defend &mdash; to tackle, to head, to block. The Spanish have simply worked out that there is only one ball on the 
pitch, and if you have it, then only your team can score. And 
so they have ball players throughout the side, even to the extent of playing six midfielders, and defenders who were once 
midfielders, in defensive positions. They do not carry a single 
player who cannot play with the ball to his feet and be part of 
a network that can be trusted to circulate the ball and utterly 
dominate possession. Spain regularly 'out possesses' their opponents at unheard of ratios as high as 60&ndash;70%. This means 
that the opposition routinely has less than half the game to 
score and win.</p>
2. spain does not play the contested Ball.
<p>An english commentator exclaimed during the recent tournament 'it's almost as if Spain does not want corners!' He could 
not quite believe his own words, as corners are perceived by 
almost every other football team in the world (apart from 
Barcelona, naturally) as an excellent offensive opportunity. 
But what the commentator said was actually true. Spain does 
indeed not want corners because they see not an opportunity 
to score a goal but rather a threat to something they prize 
more &mdash; possession of the ball. Just as you cannot concede a 
goal when you have the ball, Spain has understood that you 
can only score one when you do have it. So they keep the ball 
at all costs, even if that means foregoing a (poor) goal scoring 
opportunity. </p>
<p>In a corner situation, the most obvious outcome is a contested ball &mdash; players from both teams would rise to meet it, 
and either side, depending on the timing of the jump, has a 
reasonable chance of getting the ball. For Spain, these odds 
are not good enough, and they would prefer to retain possession in order to create another chance with better odds in a 
later phase. </p>
<p>This results in the Spanish often being accused of wanting to 'walk the ball' into the net, an accusation based on the 
assumption that Spanish team are populated purely by artists 
who want to score only aesthetically pleasing goals. This is 
a wrong characterization. Spain is populated by mathematicians, who have worked out, as professional gamblers at any 
casino might, how to play the percentages, and that you'll 
actually win more games by taking less chances. You simply 
need better chances. </p>
3. spain does not shoot unless they have a very
good chance of scoring the goal.
<p>Spain often wins 1-0. They do not do this, as the Italians 
might, by scoring first and expertly defending a lead, or as 
the english might, by battling through ninety minutes of constant turnover and winning it through superior morale. They 
do it by selecting only great opportunities to attempt to score. 
You will rarely see Spain score a goal from a long distance 
shot, and they actually take very few shots from outside the 
eighteen yard box. This is because a low percentage shot is 
just another way of losing possession of the ball. even as the 
Spanish are tiki-taka-ing their way in your penalty box, their 
primary concern is thinking about possession and not to lose 
it, rather than to necessarily score a goal in that phase of play. 
Spain would happily make dozens of short passes to get into 
the penalty box, only to take another dozen to leave it again, 
if it mean't retaining the ball and being patient for the right 
opportunity to score. The english &mdash; and to be fair, almost everyone else &mdash; would 'force' it if given a similar situation, and 
maybe or maybe not score, maybe or maybe not lose possession in the attempt of doing so. Spain simply does not tolerate 
this element of chance.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: this is a remarkable Spanish team but there is 
more science behind what they do than people realise. They 
have simply realised a truth that every other nation seems to 
have forgotten &mdash; that there is only one ball on the pitch, and 
if you have it, you <i>cannot</i> lose. And so they have geared their 
entire team around possessing the ball to the extent of selecting personnel whose predominant ability is passing and possessing it, irrespective of what position they nominally play 
on the field.</p>

<b><h2>How effective would sumo wrestlers 
be as NFL linemen?</h2>
John DeMarchi, Have intensely followed the draft for 25 
years; have attended 16 NFL Drafts; longtime football fan.</b>
<p>Fascinating question, and a good one.<br/>
only forty two sumos on the globe can compete at <i>makuu<br/>
chi</i> level &mdash; sumo's top level. The rest of sumo works sort of <br/>
like baseball, with a minor league system featuring six tiers <br/>
and a total of about six hundred and thirty wrestlers.
So to be a sumo "pro," you can't be a slug. You have to <br/>
be a huge, powerful, explosive, low-center-of-gravity athlete, 
with exceptional balance and short-area quickness, and rare 
toughness. every one of those skills/attributes is a positive 
for an nFL offensive or defensive lineman. It's also why some 
college heavyweight wrestlers succeed as nFL lineman &mdash; the <br/>
skill set translates.<br/>
Let's take the top forty two sumos (<i>makuuchi</i>). Could any <br/>
of them make it as an nFL lineman?<br/>
Could a sumo make it as an nFL Defensive end? no <br/>
chance &mdash; they would lack the top end speed to succeed. <br/>
Though a sumo could absolutely sink butt, stack the point, <br/>
and anchor against the run, I'd have to question whether any <br/>
sumo would have the speed and lateral mobility necessary to <br/>
burst upfield, dip his shoulder and redirect to a quarterback <br/>
as a De needs to do thirty to forty times a game. I'd question <br/>
whether a sumo could consistently counter and string moves <br/>
together in open space at nFL speed. endurance is also a <br/>
huge problem for the sumo; a typical De needs to play sixty to <br/>
seventy downs per game. I doubt a four to five hundred pound <br/>
sumo could handle that workload. A sumo is noT going to <br/>
be J.J. Watt, who plays three-technique De (between offensive guard and tackle, or five-technique De (outside offensive <br/>
tackle's outside shoulder) like say, Mario Williams. Can't see <br/>
it.<br/>
But at defensive tackle,<i> especially nose tackle</i>, my answer <br/>
is . . . maybe. The job of a nose tackle is to tie up two offensive <br/>
blockers (usually the guard and center); the ability to be an <br/>
immovable object who occupies space sounds a lot like . . . key <br/>
attributes of a sumo. one can debate whether a sumo would <br/>
have the upper body strength necessary to play nose tackle &mdash; <br/>
I'm not sure sumos bench press upwards of four hundred and <br/>
fifty pounds &mdash; but for quickness, size and lower body power, <br/>
it's possible a sumo could play the nose. Plus, most nose tackles are two-down players, who come off the field in obvious <br/>
passing situations. That means, the sumo would need to survive thirty to forty snaps a game. That could be doable. 
As a 4-3 defensive tackle, I'd say no, since one-gappers in <br/>
that scheme need much more speed and mobility than sumos <br/>
have. <br/>
In other words, with top strength training, could a sumo <br/>
be Ted Washington, Kris Jenkins, or Paul Soloai type player? 
Maybe. But a penetrating 4-3 tackle like a Warren Sapp or <br/>
Kyle Williams? no way.<br/>
on offense, I can't see a sumo offensive tackle &mdash; definitely <br/>
not a blindside left tackle, but not even a right tackle, either. <br/>
There is way too much space to cover for an nFL tackle <br/>
against speedy pass rushing Des and oLBs, and the sumo <br/>
simply lacks the top end speed and frankly, height in many <br/>
cases (the average nFL offensive tackle is 6-5), to succeed.
Put it this way &mdash; if DeMarcus Ware comes off the corner, <br/>
can a sumo block him? If JPP bursts upfield then counters <br/>
back inside, can a sumo jam him? I cannot see that happening.<br/>
But at offensive guard or center, again, girth, power in <br/>
space, and lower body explosion would be huge attributes. <br/>
no, I can't see a four hundred pound sumo pulling guard; yes, <br/>
I could see a four hundred pound sumo drive-blocking guard. <br/>
Again, he would need top-strength training, but essentially, <br/>
a sumo CoULD be a bigger (niners oG) Mike Iupati-type <br/>
player &mdash; a mauler. The key issue isn't so much run blocking <br/>
on the first level (vs. defensive line); it's whether the sumo <br/>
could get to the second level and block linebackers in the run <br/>
game, and whether the sumo has the mobility and quickness <br/>
to handle speed rushers in the passing game. Again, the other <br/>
issue is that an offensive lineman typically plays 95-100% of <br/>
the offensive snaps. Could a sumo survive that, from a pure <br/>
endurance standpoint? Questionable &mdash; since that's not what <br/>
a sumo trains for, typically.<br/>
For example, nate newton &mdash; a multiple Pro Bowler for <br/>
Dallas at oG &mdash; had a sumo type physique. But he also had <br/>
rare feet and the ability to locate and crush people in space. <br/>
I can't see a Larry Allen-type sumo &mdash; none of them would <br/>
be that fluid in space &mdash; but could a sumo's understanding of <br/>
balance and leverage enable him to succeed at nFL guard or <br/>
center? Maybe. Mike Williams of the Redskins is around a <br/>
three hundred fifty five pound guard, so it isn't unprecedented.
The three biggest lies in the nFL are height, weight, and <br/>
speed. But it is RARe for players over three hundred and seventy five pounds to be drafted and productive in the nFL. The <br/>
heaviest player drafted in nFL history was Buffalo seventh <br/>
rounder Leslie Michael Jasper, three hundred and ninety four 
pounds, two years ago &mdash; he is now in Arena football. oG Jamie nails was drafted at three hundred eighty seven pounds 
by the Bills about fifteen years ago, and he played decent ball 
for Buffalo and Miami &mdash; but only after slimming down to 
three hundred and fifty five pounds. oT Aaron Gibson went 
around three hundred and eighty pounds when the Lions 
drafted him in the 1990s, but he ate his way out of the league. 
oT Mike Williams of the Bills was in the three hundred and 
sixty five to seventy five pound range; he bombed as a tackle, 
and played guard at thirty six, eventually. oT Leonard Davis 
tipped the scales at around three hundred and seventy pounds 
on draft day; he also had to move inside to guard to make it <br/>
in the nFL.<br/>
Most nFL plays take three to four seconds. I have no <br/>
doubt a sumo could gain leverage, and maybe even win the <br/>
initial one to two seconds on a confrontation; the challenge <br/>
is, could he sustain, and deal with counter-move (especially <br/>
lateral one) and the speed on the nFL game after his initial <br/>
strike? Unclear.<br/>
on defense, the big men always play inside; occasionally, <br/>
a guy like Ted ("Mount") Washington plays really well at a <br/>
listed weight of three hundred and thirty five pounds, and <br/>
actual weight of around four hundred pounds, but it is not <br/>
common. Fridge Perry was listed at three hundred and sixty <br/>
pounds &mdash; he also played in the three hundred and seventy five <br/>
to four hundred range for a lot of his career. But typically, <br/>
DTs are in the three hundred to three hundred and thirty <br/>
pound range, and nose tackle go three hundred and twenty to <br/>
three hundred and sixty or so. <br/>
Here is where I Do think a sumo could make it &mdash; as a situational (max fifteen to twenty downs a game) two-gap, nose <br/>
tackle who could not be moved in the run game. Granted, the <br/>
sumo is not going to have any pass rush skills, save maybe <br/>
a bull rush. But because of the sumo's understanding of leverage, his mass, his balance, and his explosive lower body <br/>
power, he would be a load to move inside for any offensive <br/>
lineman (assuming again, the sumo committed to an upperbody weight regimen training typical for the nFL).
Five more points. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Don't underrate the sumo's ability to use his hands &mdash; especially to hold &mdash; which, though illegal, is vitally important 
to offensive line success. For those unfamiliar with sumo 
moves, there is a list of sixty moves sumos have used to 
end matches since 2000, about twelve of which are the 
key sumo moves &mdash; http://www.sumotalk.com/rules.htm. 
Hand punch is a big deal in sumo &mdash; just as it is in the 
nFL.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Don't underrate the sumo's ability to train, and the rigorous discipline and drive it takes to succeed at the elite 
sumo level. A pro sumo would likely be VeRY coachable, 
and could probably pick up nFL blocking or run-stuffing 
techniques pretty quickly. You give a <i>makuuchi</i> to say, Dallas oL coach Hudson Houck for one to two years, and I 
would not bet against that guy being at least a useful situation player. Sumos pick up technique astonishingly well.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Don't underrate the sumo's balance. Consider that to win 
a sumo grappling match, a wrestler must force his opponent to step out of the ring, oR force his opponent to 
touch the ground with any part of his body other than 
the bottom of his feet. Sumos are exceptional athletes at 
leverage; that is a crucial skill for nFL intterior lineman.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Don't underrate the sumo's toughness. These are four 
to five hundred pound men who pummel and slam into 
each other at speed WITHoUT PADDInG oR eQUIPMenT. That toughness translates exceptionally well to 
nFL positional requirements. Rugby players have made 
it in the nFL (albeit primarily as kickers so far). Why 
not sumos?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Sumos are athletes; they are not just big, fat guys. These 
athletes have great quickness, especially on initial strikes 
and blows; that also translates well to the type of interior 
line contact they would see in the nFL.</p>
<p><i>Overall, I don't think a four hundred plus pound sumo 
could make it in the NFL as an every-down player</i>. But as 
a situational player (goal line; short yardage; etc.), I could 
absolutely see it. Anyone who remembers three hundred and 
sixty plus pound William "Refrigerator" Perry scoring in Super Bowl XX will know what I am saying.</p>
<p>Could a three hundred and fifty to four hundred pound 
sumo make it as a full-time guard, or nose tackle? Would love 
to see one of the <i>makuuchi</i> try it.</p>

<b><h2>Is wrestling fake?</h2>
Anon User</b><br/>
things that are predetermined or fake
<p><b>The match duration, main moves, finishing moves and outcome are predetermined. </b>The major events of a match are 
planned and discussed beforehand, and so is the outcome. 
Some major events are definitely planned &mdash; for instance, 
someone might interfere in a match just as the bad guy, or 
'heel,' is about to lose. The duration of the match is also predetermined, and the time is kept by the referee. If you time 
the matches on, say, WWe, you might notice that there are 
broadly five, fifteen, and twenty five minute matches. </p>
<p><b>The referee is not just a neutral bystander</b>
. The referee 
keeps track of time and tells wrestlers when to wrap up a 
match. He also helps communicate things between wrestlers, and assists in the overall story by "accidentally" getting 
bumped into during the course of a match, so that the bad 
guy or "heel" can cheat. Sometimes, when a wrestler wants 
things to get a bit bloody, the referee may slip a razor to him 
to cut himself (and collect it back later). At the same time, 
the referee needs to keep within the illusion of rulekeeping 
(disqualifications, count-outs, pinfalls). Lastly, the referee has 
the full discretion to stop a match if one of the wrestlers is 
seriously injured, and he has to balance this discretion with 
the show's need to follow the scripted narrative. </p>
<p><b>Much (but not all) of a wrestling match is spontaneous. </b>
Wrestlers "call spots" to each other, ie, instruct each other 
about moves they will give or want to receive. Usually this 
is discreet, though occasionally one might be able to hear or 
spot it on TV. </p>
<p><b>Selling, or exaggerating moves. </b>
Some moves, like the 
"stunner" and the "cutter", are not particularly painful for the 
receiving wrestler and he is the one who has to 'sell' it to make 
it look convincing. You might see wrestlers jump a couple of 
feet away after getting a chop or an uppercut &mdash; some 'sell' 
more than others. The powerhouse wrestlers, of course, deliberately "no sell" moves. If you don't 'sell' right, it looks bad. </p>
<p><b>Wrestlers protecting each other</b>
. You will find that high 
flying moves almost always hit their target, and in fact it can 
be quite obvious in a few cases that the receiving wrestlers 
open their arms and bodies to 'catch' the attacking wrestler. 
Wrestlers help each other out in potentially dangerous moves 
by, for instance, tapping the receiving wrestler when he is 
about to execute the move (the 'DDT'), or by releasing the 
arms of the receiving wrestler so he can protect his face and 
head upon impact with the mat (Triple H's 'Pedigree'). Very 
large, or powerful wrestlers must protect opponents, for instance, by not putting all his weight on the receiving wrestler 
in high-impact moves.</p>
<p><b>Wrestlers protecting themselves</b>
. Wrestlers will brace 
themselves for impact, for instance, by falling in a certain way 
or using their hands and knees to cushion an impact so they 
don't hit their heads. In some potentially dangerous moves, 
like the Undertaker's tombstone piledriver, you can actually see the receiving wrestler literally hugging the attacking 
wrestler tightly as a precaution. </p>
<p>The dangerous part of the tombstone piledriver here is 
that the attacking wrestler (wearing black) might lose his 
grip on an opponent (wearing white) who is suspended upside down with no protection to his head. Done correctly, the 
receiving wrestler actually does not impact the ground at all. 
His long hair and the speed of the movement disguises the 
fact that receiving wrestler's head is above the attacking wrestler's knees. </p>
<p><b>Wrestlers assisting each other</b>
. Like Brian says, although 
wrestlers are very strong and able to carry much more than 
their own body weight, many moves still require the assistance of the receiver. The 'chokeslam,' for instance, often requires the receiving wrestler to bend his knees and kick off
the ground a bit. </p>
<p><b>Wrestlers hating each other</b>
. of course they (usually) 
don't hate each other all that much. The strange thing about 
wrestling is that you have to both hit the opponent and protect him, which compounds the already complex working 
dynamic between wrestlers who travel with each other two 
hundred days in a year in the WWe's case. </p>
<p><b>Punching / hitting with hands</b>
. Wrestlers don't punch 
each other like boxers do. They seldom hit each other with 
the knuckles of their fists, but with the back of the hand, or 
the wrist, or some part of the hand/arm that is less sharp than 
the knuckle. They are very restrained in this way, but a good 
wrestler will know how to disguise this restraint with his body 
language or with his hitting 'technique.'</p>
<p><b>Stamping</b>
. Punches make little sound. Wrestlers stamp 
their feet on the ground as they snap into a punch to generate 
what sounds like an impressive, audible punch. But it's their 
feet. A good wrestler will know how to make this stamping 
look natural and look necessary for gaining momentum. </p>
things that are real
<p><b>Taking a bump (how wrestlers fall).</b>
 Wrestlers actually take 
a bit more pain than they have to. When the wrestler takes 
a "back bump," he is actually slamming himself on the mat 
with more force than he has to. The mats are rigged with microphones to amplify the sound, but those can only go so far. </p>
<p><b>Chair and table shots. </b>
They're not fake props. The steel 
chairs are really steel chairs. In some cases, some props like 
tables may be pre-cut, but this is so that they break in a predictable fashion and therefore not injure the wrestler with 
unexpected splinters. </p>
<p><b>The pain.</b>
 The mats aren't concrete, but they're not mattresses either. There is some padding, but it doesn't save the 
wrestlers from feeling sore all week long. It hurts when you 
slam onto the mat. It hurts when you're whipped into a metal 
railing, steel steps, hit by a chair, a belt, a ring bell, a 2-by-4. </p>
<p><b>The soreness</b>
. People forget that while the top MMA 
fighters and boxers only fight a handful of times a year (if 
that). Those fights are brutal, but leave enough time for the 
body to recuperate. WWe wrestlers tour two hundred days 
in the year. The biggest WWe stars may wrestle three or four 
times a week (Raw, Smackdown, and at least one untelevised 
house show), in addition to media commitments and travelling time (which can amount to twenty to forty hours &mdash; the 
WWe travels to almost every continent on the planet). Most 
wrestlers go through the entire year sore or suffering from 
a nagging pain that never goes away. A few, like edge and 
Shawn Michaels, have suffered well-documented back problems. edge had to retire in his prime to avoid spending the 
rest of his life in a wheelchair. </p>
<p><b>The athleticism</b>
. Many people disparage WWe wrestlers as actors, but pro-wrestling requires a great deal of athleticism. Many of the WWe's roster, past and present, are 
athletes in their own right. Kurt Angle was a olympic gold 
medalist, and of the current roster, Alberto Del Rio has a 
background as an MMA fighter and a gold medalist in GrecoRoman wrestling at the Pan-American games. A few others 
have excellent amateur backgrounds &mdash; Jack Swagger was a 
two-time All-American. </p>
<p><b>The concussions. </b>
Concussions are well documented in 
wrestling. Many promotions like the WWe no longer allow 
chair shots on the head due to the very real effects on health. 
You don't need to be hit on the head to have a concussion. 
When you are dealing with wrestlers in the 100-200 kg (or 
200-400 lbs) range, one can get a concussion from the most 
innocuous of wrestling moves. The wrestler often continues 
wrestling through a concussion. Depending on his level of 
awareness, his opponent(s) often improvise a finish. In this link 
(http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2012/0818/555395/
kurt-angle/), Kurt Angle talks about how Triple H and The 
Rock improvised a finish when he suffered a concussion during a triple threat match involving the three. </p>
<p><b>Submission moves</b>
. Some submission holds are for show. 
The "sleeper" is usually meant for the wrestlers to rest and 
'call spots' for the rest of the match. It is perfect because the 
wrestlers get to be within whispering distance of each other. They call spots, of course, after hiding or angling their 
mouths away from the cameras. The common feature of almost all submission moves is that they meant to be adjustable 
(ie, can be loosened a bit) and have a few exit spots to allow 
the receiver to counter the move. However, many submission 
moves genuinely hurt (like Bret Hart's 'sharpshooter'). Many 
of the submission moves you see on the WWe are borrowed 
from "real" sports like MMA and jiujitsu &mdash; such as the arm 
trap triangle choke or the gogoplata.</p>

<b><h2>What does it feel like to be the 
CEO of a start-up?</h2>
Paul DeJoe, Least valuable person Ecquire.com</b>
<p>Very tough to sleep most nights of the week. Weekends don't 
mean anything to you anymore. Closing a round of financing 
is not a relief. It means more people are depending on you to 
turn their investment into twenty times what they gave you. </p>
<p>It's very difficult to "turn it off." But at the same time, television, movies, and vacations become so boring to you when 
your company's future might be sitting in your inbox or in the 
results of a new A/B test you decide to run. </p>
<p>You feel guilty when you're doing something you like doing outside of the company. only through years of wrestling 
with this internal fight do you recognize how the word "balance" is an art that is just as important as any other skill set 
you could ever hope to have. You begin to see how valuable 
creativity is and that you must think differently not only to 
win, but to see the biggest opportunity. You recognize that 
you get your best ideas when you're not staring at a screen. 
You see immediate returns on healthy distractions.</p>
<p>You start to respect the Duck. Paddle like hell under the 
water, but be smooth and calm on top where everyone can see 
you. You learn the hard way that if you lose your cool, you lose.</p>
<p>You always ask yourself if you are changing The World in 
a good way. Are people's lives better for having known you? <br/>
You are creative, and when you have an idea, it has no 
filter before it becomes a reality. This feeling is why you can't 
do anything else. <br/>
You start to see that the word "entrepreneur" is a personality. It's difficult to talk to your friends that are not risking 
the same things you are because they are content with not 
pushing themselves or putting it all out there in the public 
with the likelihood of failure staring at them everyday. You 
start to turn a lot of your conversations with relatives into 
how they might exploit opportunities for profit. Those close 
to you will view your focus as something completely different 
because they don't understand. You don't blame them. They 
can't understand if they haven't done it themselves. It's why 
you will gravitate towards other entrepreneurs. You will find 
reward in helping other entrepreneurs.<br/>
Your job is to create a vision, a culture, to get the right 
people on the bus and to inspire. When you look around at a 
team that believes in the vision as much as you do and trusts 
you will do the right thing all the time, it's a feeling that can't 
be explained. The exponential productivity from great people 
will always amaze you. It's why finding the right team is the 
most difficult thing you will do but the most important. This 
learning will affect your life significantly. You will not settle 
for things anymore because you will see what is possible when 
you hold out for the best and push to find people that are the 
best. You don't have a problem anymore being honest with 
people about not cutting it. <br/>
You start to see that you're a leader, and you have to lead 
or you can't be involved with it at all. You turn down acquisition offers because you need to run the show, you feel like 
your team is the best in the world, and you can do anything 
with hard work. Quitting is not an option. <br/>
You have to be willing to sleep in your car and laugh 
about it. You have to be able to laugh at many things, because 
when you think of the worse things in the world that could 
happen to your company, they will happen. Imagine working for something for two years and then having to throw it 
out completely because you see one day that it's wrong. You 
realize that if your team is having fun and can always laugh, 
you won't die, and in fact, the opposite will happen: you will 
learn to love the journey and look forward to what you do 
everyday, even at the lowest times. You'll hear not to get too 
low when things are bad and not to get too high when things 
are good, and you'll even give that advice. But you'll never take 
it, because being in the middle all the time isn't exciting, and 
an even keel is never worth missing out on something worth 
celebrating. You'll become addicted to finding the hardest 
challenges because there's a direct relationship between how 
difficult something is and the euphoria of a feeling when you 
do the impossible. <br/>
You realize that it was much more fun when you didn't 
have money, and that money might be the worse thing you 
could have as a personal goal. If you're lucky enough to genuinely feel this way, it is a surreal feeling that is the closest 
thing to peace, because you realize it's the challenges and the 
work that you love. Your currencies are freedom, autonomy, 
responsibility, and recognition. Those happen to be the same 
currencies of the people you want around you. <br/>
You feel like a parent to your customers in that they will 
never realize how much you love them, and they validate that 
you are not crazy. You want to hug every one of them. They 
mean the world to you. <br/>
You learn the most about yourself, more than any other 
vocation, as an entrepreneur. You learn what you do when 
you get punched in the face many, many times. You learn 
what you do when no one is looking and when no one would 
find out. You learn that you are bad at many things, lucky if 
you're good at a handful of things, and the only thing you can 
ever be great at is being yourself, which is why you can never 
compromise it. You learn how power and recognition can be 
addicting and see how they could corrupt so many. <br/>
You become incredibly grateful for the times that things 
were going as bad as they possibly could. Most people won't 
get to see this in any other calling. When things are really 
bad, there are people that come running to help and don't 
think twice about it. Tal Raviv, Gary Smith, Joe Reyes, Toan 
Dang, Vincent Cheung, eric elinow, Abe Marciano are some 
of them. I will forever be in their debt, and I could never repay 
them nor would they want or expect to be repaid. <br/>
You begin to realize that in life, the luckiest people in the 
world only get one shot at being a part of something great. 
Knowing this helps you make sense of your commitment. <br/>
of all the things said though, it's exciting. every day is 
different and so exciting. even when it's bad, it's exciting. 
Knowing that your decisions will not only affect you but many 
others also is a weight that I would rather have any day than 
the weight of not controlling my future. That's why I could 
not do anything else.</p>

<b><h2>What factors led to the bursting 
of the Internet bubble of the late 
1990s?</h2>
<p>Steve Case, Co-founder of AOL; now Chairman of Case 
Foundation and Revolution (Zipcar, LivingSocial, Exclusive Resorts, Everyday Health, Revolution Money, Miraval, 
etc)</p></b>
<p>The Internet went through some fairly predictable phases. 
The first was a <b>research</b> phase (the 70s), when some for<br/>
ward thinkers were working on early research projects for <br/>
what was then called videotex, teletext, 2-way TV, etc. These <br/>
were experiments in labs as consumers did not have PCs or <br/>
any practical way to access these services. Futurists like Alvin <br/>
Toffler wrote about the notion of an "electronic cottage" (he <br/>
wrote The Third Wave in 1979), but it was considered a piein-the-sky prediction.<br/>
next was the <b>pioneering</b> phase (early 80s to early 90s), <br/>
when a relatively small number of people were trying to build <br/>
interactive services, but it was an uphill battle. Few people <br/>
used them (and the Internet itself was still limited to government/educational institutions &mdash; indeed, it was illegal to use 
it for commercial purposes). The conventional wisdom was 
that the market would always be limited to hackers/hobbyists. AoL was the first "Internet" company (it was actually 
called an "online services" or "interactive services" company at 
the time) to go public, and I remember on the road show (in 
1992) explaining why we thought this would be a large market someday. Given we had been in business seven years and <br/>
had less than 200,000 users, most were skeptical. <br/>
Suddenly, interest in the Internet took off and we entered <br/>
a <b>growth</b> phase (mid-90s). A lot of factors contributed to this: <br/>
consumers started buying PCs in large numbers, PCs started <br/>
shipping with pre-installed modems, network costs dropped <br/>
sharply, making access more affordable, software was developed to improve ease of use for mainstream users, the World <br/>
Wide Web emerged, the first wave of start-ups were developed, etc. Suddenly, a market that had been nascent for more <br/>
than a decade was showing signs of life. As an example, AoL <br/>
went from 200,000 users to 1 million in a two year period.
This sudden surge in interest led to the <b>hype</b> phase (late <br/>
90s), when people came out of the woodwork to be part of the <br/>
Internet gold rush. Hundreds of companies were started, and <br/>
everybody wanted to invest. Valuations shot up. Me-too companies became prevalent. Crazy ideas that had no business <br/>
model and no realistic chance of success were viewed as the <br/>
next big thing. As millions of people decided to go online virtually overnight, companies like AoL expanded rapidly. We <br/>
were literally getting America online, adding 1 million new <br/>
users every month or two. our market value soared, from $70 <br/>
million at the time of the 1992 IPo to $150 billion in early <br/>
2000. <br/>
not surprisingly, this hype phase was followed by <b>despair</b><br/>
(early 2000s). Some called this the Internet's nuclear winter. <br/>
Investors ran from the sector and valuations plummeted. <br/>
Some companies lost 99% of their market value in a matter of <br/>
months. Dozens went bankrupt. The sector went from being <br/>
the hottest thing on Wall Street to being cold. new companies could not raise start-up capital. Most people thought the <br/>
Internet as a passing fad. <br/>
That then led to a <b>recovery</b> phase (mid 2000s). Some of <br/>
the companies started in the hype phase built large franchises 
(Yahoo, eBay, Amazon, etc), and a handful of newer companies got traction (Google, in particular). This was a slower, 
steadier, saner period of growth. Investors tended to be selective, betting on the winners that survived the bust that were <br/>
consolidating their positions.<br/>
now we appear to be in a <b>boom</b> phase again. The success <br/>
of social media (Facebook in particular) and more recently <br/>
social commerce (Groupon and LivingSocial) has reminded <br/>
people of how quickly large, profitable, valuable franchises <br/>
can be built. As a result, there is once again a rush to invest. <br/>
This will inevitably lead to many disappointments, but the difference now vs. a decade ago is that companies have real business models, significant revenues, etc. Valuations are likely to <br/>
move up &mdash; or down &mdash; quickly, but the underlying businesses <br/>
are for the most part pretty stable.<br/>
This cycle &mdash; hope, hype, despair, rebound, etc &mdash; has been <br/>
interesting to watch (and live through) over the past 25+ <br/>
years. It is is worth pointing out though that what happened <br/>
with the Internet is not unique to the Internet &mdash; the cycles <br/>
just happened a little faster. Most significant inventions and <br/>
industries (cars, etc) have undergone similar transitions. Success seems to require a mix of passion, perspective, and perseverance.</p>

<h3>instagram</h3>
<b><h2>What was the genesis of 
Instagram?</h2>
Kevin Systrom, CEO, co-founder</b>
<p>First off, we have to say that we never expected the overwhelming response that we've seen. We went from literally a 
handful of users to the #1 free photography app in a matter 
of hours. But as my cofounder Mike Krieger likes to say, Instagram is an app that only took eight weeks to build and ship, 
but was a product of over a year of work.</p>
<p>The story starts when I worked at nextstop. While I was 
there working in marketing, I started doing more and more 
engineering at night on simple ideas that helped me learn 
how to program (I don't have any formal CS degree or training). one of these ideas was combining elements of Foursquare (check-ins) with elements of Mafia Wars (hence the 
name Burbn). I figured I could build a prototype of the idea 
in HTML5 and get it to some friends. Those friends ended up 
using the prototype without any branding elements or design 
at all. I spent weekends working on improving the prototype 
for my friends. At a party for the Hunch folks, I ran into a 
bunch of people who would basically make starting Burbn a 
reality. At that party were two people from Baseline Ventures 
and Andreessen Horowitz. I showed the prototype, and we 
decided we'd meet up for coffee to talk about it. After the first 
meeting, I decided to take the dive and leave my job to go solo 
and see if Burbn could be a company. Within two weeks of 
leaving, I raised $500k from both Baseline and Andreessen 
Horowitz, and started work on finding a team.</p>
<p>Mike Krieger and I started talking and he decided he 
liked the idea of helping start the company. once he joined, 
we took a step back and looked at the product as it stood. 
By this time, we had built Burbn into a (private) really neat 
HTML5 mobile web app that let you: Check in to locations, 
Make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out 
with friends, Post pictures, and much more.</p>
<p>We decided that if we were going to build a company, we 
wanted to focus on being really good at one thing. We saw 
mobile photos as an awesome opportunity to try out some new 
ideas. We spent one week prototyping a version that focused 
solely on photos. It was pretty awful. So we went back to creating a native version of Burbn. We actually got an entire version of Burbn done as an iPhone app, but it felt cluttered, and 
overrun with features. It was really difficult to decide to start 
from scratch, but we went out on a limb, and basically cut 
everything in the Burbn app except for its photo, comment, 
and like capabilities. What remained was Instagram. (We renamed because we felt it better captured what you were doing &mdash; an instant telegram of sorts. It also sounded camera-y).</p>
<p>So eight weeks later, we gave it to our friends, beta tested, 
bug fixed, etc. and then we decided it was ready to ship. We've 
got a long road ahead of us, but we're encouraged by the adoption and usage that has far exceeded our bets pre-launch.</p>

<h3>video games</h3>
<b><h2>Am I missing out by not playing 
any video or console games?</h2>
David Cole, Designer at Quora</b><br/>
Reasons why you might not be missing out:
<p><b>You consider art or recreation a waste of time in general.</b>
 If
you believe this, then you can toss video games into the same 
pile with novels, films, sports, hiking, and chess. I don't think 
there's any way around this, some people just want to feel 
productive with everything they do.</p>
<p><b>You lack the capacity to derive meaning from video games.</b>
I don't think there's a category of art where I haven't connected to at least one piece (opera, maybe?) but I'd bet there 
are people for whom this is true. If you've given the form an 
earnest try and got nothing from it, I wouldn't blame ya for 
shrugging it off in favor of art you do find meaningful.</p>
<p><b>You don't want to deal with learning or skill-based challenge 
in your art.</b> Games are exceptional from other forms of art in 
that they often require skill to get through, or at least a learning period around the input methods. This can be alienating, 
and I don't blame people for being turned off by this. We've 
developed input and mechanical tropes (the platformer, the 
first person shooter) to help smooth out the learning curve, 
but you still need to learn one before you can play the rest.</p>
If this doesn't describe you, it might just be a function of misconception or inexperience:
<p><b>You think video games lack artistic or recreational capacity.</b>
You're mistaken. We're witnessing the birth and rapid evolution of a brand new art form, dense with new expressive 
faculty. To be alive right now and choose to ignore this strikes 
me as a shame.</p>
<p><b>You think video games require a lot more of your time relative to other forms of art and recreation.</b> Many of the games 
that get the most outside attention (<i>Skyrim</i>, <i>Minecraft</i>, <i>Grand 
Theft Auto</i>) also happen to be massive time sinks. Good games 
can be found at any length imaginable from a few minutes 
(<i>Passage</i>) to a few hours (<i>Portal</i>) to the more typical fifteen to 
twenty hours for your mainstream, large budget games. These 
are no less a time sink than a novel.</p>
<p><b>You haven't played a video game you connected with.</b>
 I'd 
bet this is the case for most people who dismiss video games. 
There's this myth of the "gamer," or that people who play 
games are a specific kind of person. Movie goers and book 
readers do not have an equivalent identity. This is problematic: people feel like they're either inside or outside the world 
of games. </p>
<p>In reality, games are more diverse than people think, as 
are the people who play them. If you don't want a game that 
requires hand-eye coordination and action-based challenges, 
you can play sim games, or turn based strategy games. Within 
the interactive fiction and experimental "art" game communities you can find games that lack challenge entirely. </p>
<p>Because it's a medium in constant evolution and experimentation, it's hard to dabble and understand what's out 
there. If you really are wondering if there's a game out there 
for you, consider asking a friend with diverse gaming tastes 
what they might recommend.</p>

<b><h2>Why did Steve Jobs choose not to 
effectively treat his cancer?</h2>
Ramzi Amri, MD/PhD Candidate, MGH Surgical Oncology</b>
<p>I hesitated a long time before addressing this topic. To avoid 
any risks of bias, let me start by stating that all the details 
on Jobs' specific case are based on secondary sources, albeit 
from reliable sources in the media. I write this on a personal 
title, I do not pretend to know anything about the case on 
a personal level, and I never participated in the care of Mr. 
Jobs. I base all my cancer figures on sources from biomedical 
research known to me.</p>
<p>I respect the privacy of, and in no way wish to offend, 
anyone mourning his passing. I have the profoundest respect 
for Mr. Jobs and his legacy, but I feel that in the spirit of his 
progressive view of the world, learning from his case is an 
appropriate way to look back on the facts concerning his life 
and legacy.</p>
<p>I have done a year and a half of research on the type of 
tumor that affected Steve Jobs as a medical student in Amsterdam and have some strong opinions on his case, not only 
as an admirer of his work, but also as a cancer researcher who 
has the impression that his disease course has been far from 
optimal.</p>
<p>Let me cut to the chase: Mr. Jobs allegedly chose to undergo all sorts of alternative treatment options before opting 
for conventional medicine.</p>
<p>This was, of course, a freedom he had all the rights to 
take, but given the circumstances, it seems sound to assume 
that Mr. Jobs' choice for alternative medicine could have led 
to an unnecessarily early death.</p>
<p>Again, please understand that I have no knowledge of the 
specific case, I'm just trying to give insights on his <i>a priori</i>
odds of cure. These are independent of his case and mere indicators that somehow his case turned for the worse when 
it statistically was improbable. What made this happen will 
remain in the domain of speculations. We're here to see if his 
therapeutic choices are <b>possibly </b>what made this happen.</p>
First, let me clarify a few things about his disease:
<p><b>Neuroendocrine tumors are far less deadly than "ordinary" pancreatic cancer.</b><br/>
The big confusion in the media is that Jobs had pancreatic 
cancer. Though his tumor might have originated in his pancreas, we're not speaking of the dreaded pancreatic <b>adenocarcinoma </b>that has such a horrible prognosis and makes up for 
95% of pancreatic tumors.<br/>
Jobs is cited to have said himself that he had an islet-cell 
tumor, which is a colloquially used, less accurate name for 
the other 5% of pancreatic tumors, so-called neuroendocrine 
tumors. <br/>
<b>Neuroendocrine tumors are relatively mild forms of cancer.</b><br/>
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine Tumors (GePneT's) are a range of tumors that mostly keep their original 
function, producing endocrine hormones.<br/>
The disadvantage of that is the havoc they wreak on the 
body due to all sorts of hormonal imbalances caused by the 
hormones they produce. on the other hand, the level of differentiation is a strong indicator of how aggressive a tumor is: 
the better a tumor is differentiated e.g. keeps the features of 
its originator, the least invasive and prone to metastasis it is.<br/>
Just to illustrate how mild these tumors can be:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
As many as 10% of autopsied persons in the general population have been reported to have one of these without 
ever having had any symptoms during their life.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Up to 30% of detected GeP-neTs are so well-differentiated they're strictly not cancers. I have even come across 
an article where insulinomas, the most common type of 
GeP-neTs were benign in 90% of the cases.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 If treated appropriately and in time, most people won't 
die from the cancer itself. In my series of patients, for 
many subtypes, the survival rate was as high as 100% over 
a decade.</p>
<b>Neuroendocrine tumors caught in time can be treated just 
by surgically removing the tumor.</b>
<p>This is a relatively low-risk treatment that &mdash; especially 
compared to chemo and radiation &mdash; has negligible disadvantages. In many cases, a simple enucleation (just cutting out 
the tumor with a safe margin around it) is enough and leaves 
no residual side-effects.</p>
now, about this specific case:<br/>
<b>Jobs had many favorable factors that indicate an early 
surgical treatment could have been curative.</b>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Mr. Jobs said himself that they caught the tumor early. 
early in GeP-neTs means in many cases that surgically 
removing the primary tumor without additional removal 
of organs is a curative with a low chance or recurrence.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> The tumor was located at a relatively clement site, the 
pancreas.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The tumor was allegedly an insulinoma, one of the best 
treatable subtypes of GeP-neTs.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 The tumor was probably well-differentiated. Mr. Jobs 
spoke of a hormonal imbalance, this points to a tumor 
that keeps its endocrine function, which is an general 
indicator of good differentiation. Well-differentiated tumors are less prone to metastasize and grow rapidly.</p>
<p><i>See table linked to below for a comprehensive illustration of 
the numbers I'm referring to, I chose an article from The Annals of Oncology as a source as it's one of the few papers freely 
accessible for everyone interested to read the full article: </i>http://
annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/9/1794<i>.</i></p>
<p><b>. . . but not treating the most innocent cancer can still 
cause it to go seriously bad.</b><br/>
I'm currently reviewing hundreds of colon cancer cases, 
and about 25% of them start with a patient that comes with 
a history of polyps. Polyps are small benign little growths in 
the lining of the intestine. They are absolutely harmless at 
first, yet slowly but surely, over years, they lose more and more 
of the above mentioned "differentiation" and some eventually 
turn to a malign colon cancer.<br/>
In fact, it is supposed that all colon cancers start as a polyp. These 25% had polyps removed, but were unlucky enough 
that between two colonoscopies, some other polyp found the 
time to grow into a real cancer. That's also why screening &mdash; 
and going there on time &mdash; is so important.<br/>
This illustrates also why leaving even the most innocent 
malign tumor to grow is just a foolish thing to do &mdash; a ticking 
time bomb.<br/>
<b>Jobs was a hippie back in the day, and a conventional 
medicine skeptic now. His reaction to the disease gave the 
disease time to spread.</b><br/>
Many mainstream media, including Cnn, stated that Mr. 
Jobs might have spent as long as two years without proper 
(conventional) treatment.<br/>
While Mr. Jobs was trying all sorts of alternative mumbojumbo I won't even bother to go through as their failure is 
now sadly irrefutably proven, his tumor grew, and grew, and 
grew . . .<br/>
<b>. . . and then it somehow grew beyond control.</b></p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Jobs waited so long before seeking normal treatment 
that he had to undergo a Whipple procedure, losing his 
pancreas and whole duodenum in 2004. This was the first 
alarming sign that his disease had progressed beyond a 
compact primary to at least a tumor so large his Pancreas 
and duodenum could not be saved.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Jobs seemingly waited long enough for the disease revealed to have spread extensively to his liver. The only reason he'd have a transplant after a GeP-neT would be 
that the tumor invaded all major parts of the liver, which 
takes a considerable amount of time. Years, in most neuroendocrine tumors. It could be that this happened before 
his diagnosis, but the risk grows exponentially with time.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
We then saw the tumor slowly draining the life out him. 
It was a horrible thing to see him lose weight and slowly 
turn into a skin and bones form of himself.</p>
<p>Yet it seems that even during this recurrent phase, Mr. Jobs 
opted to dedicate his time to Apple as the disease progressed, 
instead of opting for chemotherapy or any other conventional 
treatment.</p>
<p><b>As for the "Why?" question:</b><br/>
every patient has another view of his or her disease and 
the priorities for the treatment, or how much suffering and 
risk they're ready to endure as a trade-off for a higher chance 
of getting cured.</p>
<p>For most people, the trust in their doctor's intention to 
treat them is near-absolute. We encourage patients to inform 
themselves on the subject and stimulate personal choices, but 
the extent to which people can go through all the technicalities and the enormous pile of medical evidence is limited not 
only by the level of understanding of this specialist knowledge, but also simply by the sheer time it takes to inform oneself about this.</p>
<p>now Mr. Jobs always was a free thinker, a strong believer 
in spirituality, a vegetarian, and a known skeptic of conventional medicine. He chose to reject conventional medicine altogether for a while. He's not alone in that. We come across 
many people like this, and we all know someone in our midst 
that uses homeopathy or has this known fear of anything 
"chemical" (to those I always say that everything is chemical, 
if you think dihydrogen oxide sounds scary you should stop 
drinking water). Individual freedom of thought and choice is 
a cornerstone of our modern society, and the medical world 
makes no exception.</p>
<p>It's always an ethical puzzle if a patient chooses alternative treatment that we know from fact will not work. Yet, as 
long as the person is mentally sane, we cannot force them 
to choose a working treatment, even if it means their death. 
Sadly, even for one of the greatest personalities of the last 
hundred years, there will be no exception, and badly treated 
cancer is just as deadly for him as for anyone else . . .</p>

<b><h2>What are the best stories about 
people randomly meeting Steve 
Jobs?</h2>
Tim Smith, Principal, Applied Design Group</b>
<p>I dated for years a young woman whose father was Steve 
Jobs's neighbor in Palo Alto. I thus found myself in the neighborhood often, at dinners, or parties, etc. We would see the 
Jobs come and go &ndash; they have a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; house, no gates, 
no guards, no high fences, not even a big lot. often, leaving 
a party at my girlfriend&rsquo;s house late at night, I would drive 
past their house and you would actually see Steve sometimes, 
working on a Mac.</p>
<p>one afternoon I attended a party, driving an old Sunbeam 
Alpine sports car I had the misfortune to own at the time. After the party, I started the Alpine, pulled away from the curb, 
and &ndash; as classic British sports cars will oft do &ndash; the electrical 
system blinked out and I coasted gracefully to a stop, directly 
in front of the Jobs&rsquo; driveway.</p>
<p>Their cars weren&rsquo;t there, which was a relief to me, because 
I was sure they would consider me some weird stalker. So I 
got out, popped the hood and tried to quick-fix the electrical 
to at least move further away &ndash; and call AAA.</p>
<p>Within about fifteen minutes, of course, I heard two cars 
pull in behind me, and into the Jobs&rsquo; driveway &ndash; the Jobs were 
home. I huddled under the hood of the Alpine and hoped they 
wouldn&rsquo;t notice &ndash; although I was the only other car on the 
street. They went inside, with kids, thankfully, without saying anything. So I closed the hood and prepared to walk back 
next door to my girlfriend&rsquo;s parents house to call AAA.</p>
<p>As I was putting my jacket on, I heard a call from across 
the street behind me &ndash; the Jobs&rsquo; driveway &ndash; &ldquo;British or Italian?&rdquo; It was Jobs&rsquo;s lovely wife Laurene. &ldquo;British,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and 
acting like it.&rdquo; &ldquo;You want a beer?&rdquo; she said. I tried to decline 
(shocked I guess at first), but she insisted, said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not 
going anywhere,&rdquo; and walked back in the house &ndash; only to return with two bottles of beer.</p>
<p>I was determined not to let on that I knew exactly who I 
was talking to &ndash; I was so afraid of being cast a stalker &ndash; but 
the scene was already getting weird for me, standing by my 
broken car having a beer with Steve Jobs&rsquo;s wife. So, it got 
weirder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, we have a friend who knows all about these 
Sunbeams. We should call him.&rdquo;<br/>
I begged her not to, that I&rsquo;d call AAA and be on my way. 
She left her beer and went back in the house for a minute, 
only to return saying, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re on their way out, but said they 
would drop by to take a look.&rdquo;<br/>
By this point, I am fully resigned to whatever story is going to play out. It was starting to dawn on me that these were 
not just Silicon Valley elite &ndash; they were real people, just helping a poor guy out. It was just unexpected, given what you 
might think about people like this: it would have been so easy 
for them to just ignore me. or call the police.<br/>
Within about fifteen minutes, a very long, very black car I 
won&rsquo;t identify pulled up and &ndash; Felini could not have directed 
this &ndash; a handsome gentleman in (I think) a tuxedo, and a 
beautifully formally dressed wife emerged, to examine my car. 
This was Laurene&rsquo;s friend, the Sunbeam mechanic.<br/>
I protested, all was ignored. The tuxedoed man (who to 
this day I have no idea who he was &ndash; I&rsquo;ll call him James Bond) 
took off his jacket, opened the hood of my car, and commenced to fishing around inside, while we all visited amicably.<br/>
<i>So Steve comes out.</i><br/>
At which point &ndash; being an admirer of Jobs for many years 
&ndash; I guess I knew was inevitable, and I both dreaded and anticipated it. He ambled over. I think he had a beer too. And 
asked what was going on. He was joined by one of the kids.<br/>
The Jobs made small talk and joked with their friends 
&ndash; dressed to the nines, repairing my car &ndash; while I politely 
thanked them over and over and tried not to throw up at the 
insanity of the scene. And then of course, it got even weirder, 
or funnier, depending on whether you were me or not.<br/>
James Bond told someone to try to crank the car. I was 
talking with Laurene, so Jobs actually sits down in the Alpine 
and tries to crank it &ndash; with his kid sitting behind him. To no 
avail.<br/>
So I have to stop here &ndash; it&rsquo;s a Kodak moment &ndash; something 
you want to remember. It&rsquo;s a beautiful Fall evening in Palo 
Alto. Your car&rsquo;s broken. A formally dressed close friend of 
Steve Jobs is under the hood working on your engine. You are 
talking with Steve&rsquo;s absolutely lovely and down-to-earth wife. 
Steve is in the car, with his kid, trying to crank it.<br/>
That&rsquo;s the moment. You don&rsquo;t often get close to people like 
the Jobs, much less in a ridiculous situation like this, where 
you realize that they are just really good people. They&rsquo;re normal, funny, charitable, real people. not the people the press 
talks about. Steve is not the maniacal business and design 
despot the media loves to portray &ndash; well he is, but not always. 
These were real, nice, people.<br/>
But still Steve Jobs. The car didn&rsquo;t start. James Bond got 
his tuxedo back together, apologized to me (!) for not being 
able to fix it. Said it was the electrical (of course). They said 
their goodbyes and departed in their giant, silent black car. 
Steve said something like &ldquo;piece of shit&rdquo; as he got out, and 
walked back into the house. Classic Steve &ndash; he was right.<br/>
Laurene said, &ldquo;Come inside and use the phone.&rdquo; Still rolling with it at this point, I followed her into the house, stepping over the dirty laundry you find in everyone&rsquo;s real house 
and into the kitchen where she pointed me to a phone with 
god knows how many lines on it. I called AAA, thanked Laurene profusely (for the 50th time), and left quietly. I never 
acknowledged I had any idea who they were.<br/>
A week later, I dropped a six pack of beer off at the Jobs&rsquo; 
door, with a note saying thanks. Like anyone would have 
done, I guess.<br/>
I&rsquo;m an Apple follower. I own a fair amount of Apple stock. 
You can&rsquo;t avoid the public persona and reputation of Steve 
Jobs &ndash; the media stories. But, as with the other vignettes some 
have posted, we don&rsquo;t hear about or appreciate the personal 
side of Jobs and his family. They deserve their privacy, and it 
must be hard to maintain I&rsquo;m sure, but the flip side of that is 
that most never see how frankly normal they are. I purchased 
the bio that came out last fall, but have not started it. I hope 
that, on balance, it is as much about what a decent, probably 
brilliant, real, caring individual Steve Jobs was: a husband, 
father, neighbor &ndash; and Ceo. Tortured probably, in his brilliance. I saw him in his most personal element &ndash; family and 
friends &ndash; around a broken down car in Palo Alto one night, 
just by chance. I was lucky &ndash; and I was delighted.<br/>
It&rsquo;s one of my fondest memories.</p>

Peter Clark</b><br/>
amaZon - gryffindor
<p>Gryffindor believes in 
<i>bravery, daring</i>, and <i>nerve</i>. Amazon, a 
company that sold books online, bravely decided to risk eating into their own business with their marketplace offerings 
(which many speculated would be the downfall of Amazon), 
they have displayed great bravery in keeping the pedal to the 
floor with their Amazon Web Services, a service vastly out of 
the traditional ecommerce Amazon brand. </p>
<p>Amazon has also repeatedly shown remarkable nerve to 
governments, companies, and users. From revoking books 
from the Amazon Kindle, to revoking free shipping to American states that wanted to charge them additional costs, and 
flying in the face of record labels to offer their cloud offerings 
for hosted music.</p>
The Gryffindor element is fire, and a great fuel for fire is 
wood which you can find in the Amazon rainforest.
faceBook - hufflepuff
<p>Facebook thrives on an environment of hard work on their 
product, loyalty both from users and employees (active Facebook users use the service every day), and being non-judgemental. Which of the other three companies do you think 
would not just support, but <i>encourage</i>, applications that allowed you to throw sheep at your friends?</p>
<p>Hufflepuff is an inclusive house, and this resonates with 
various cultural jokes that bounce around the walls of Facebook, from hoodies with cryptic logos, to in-jokes on Quora. </p>
<p>Additionally, a famous Hufflepuff student, Cedric Diggory, was played by Robert Pattison, who is famous (to muggles) for his role in the Twilight trilogy, and guess what one 
of the most popular Facebook pages is? The Twilight Trilogy.

google - ravenclaw
<p>Like Ravenclaw, Google values 
<i>intelligence </i> and<i> knowledge</i>. 
Ravenclaw was founded by the Grey Lady, who was killed 
for fleeing her lover and refusing to see him again, parallels 
could be drawn between this, and Larry Page replacing eric 
Schmidt as Ceo, who had joined Larry and Sergey, and essentially replaced them as Ceo pre-IPo.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, this is the only Harry Potter house 
where <i> you answer a question</i> to enter the common room &mdash; 
which other company would you <i>ever</i> use to answer questions?</p>
apple - slytherin
<p>Most people paint Slytherin with a broad stroke of being evil. 
Some elements of Slytherin are evil, and others parts are labelled evil but perhaps simply overly ambitious.</p>
nothing could describe Apple better.
<p>Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness 
in their students. Apple has shown the most ambition (the 
most valued internet company and fastest growing company 
in the world), the most cunning (doing business deals then 
pulling them at the last moment due to Ceos blabbing, incredible utilization of already existing technology with good 
marketing to sell to users) and has shown resourcefulness only 
typically demonstrated in the most brilliant entrepreneurs &mdash; 
from the Apple Stores, to the iPad Smart Covers, to the sheer

<h3>physical appearance</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to be an 
unattractive woman?</h2>
Anne K. Halsall, extraordinaire</b>
<p>I'd like to answer this, not because I feel I am unattractive, 
but because at various points in my life, I have been treated 
as such and I want to share honestly and openly what that 
experience was like.</p>
<p>To provide some background, I have struggled with my 
weight since I was a young child, and was more or less always 
the heaviest girl in my peer groups at school. My family did 
not have a lot of money, meaning that I didn't get nice haircuts or highlights, makeup, or fashionable clothing and accessories. And finally, I was a nerdy tomboy who actively shunned 
the idea that appearance matters. I preferred sweatpants to 
jeans and didn't have the first clue about how to dress myself 
or do my hair (which was always tangled and frizzy).</p>
<p>Later on in my life, some of these issues got straightened 
out, but I remained awkward and extremely overweight until 
my mid-20s. Therefore, I've experienced both the "ugly girl at 
school" and the "unattractive woman" sides of things.</p>
childhood and youth
<p>This was honestly the hardest. Children can be cruel and overt 
in their treatment of social misfits. I was teased mercilessly, 
especially by the attractive "popular kids," on an ongoing basis 
from as early as first grade. Here are just a few things that 
happened to me in grade school and middle school:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
one boy sent me a fake love letter, which I unfortunately 
believed was true until the punchline was delivered to me 
in front of a group of other kids.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
My assigned seatmate on the bus made me sit in the aisle 
because I was "too fat" to sit on the seat and regularly 
poured soda into my hair on the 45-minute long drive to 
school.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I was only allowed to be friends with other unattractive 
people, which actually worked out because they were often 
the nicest and funniest kids. one pretty but awkward girl 
I was friends with took a chance to promote her social 
status by ditching me publicly at recess. It made perfect 
sense; she was too pretty for the ugly kids' group.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I only got valentine's day cards from the teachers.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I had crushes on people but knew that I could never be the 
object of someone else's affection. I went to school dances 
alone, if at all. I didn't exchange cute "if you like me, check 
this box" notes. I didn't go to boy/girl parties and giggle 
about "making out" the next day.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
I learned to be okay with spending a lot of time alone. Being an unattractive girl doesn't just make it hard to get a 
date. It makes it hard to make friends at all, especially in 
the tweens when a lot of the other girls are very focused 
on appearance.</p>
young adulthood
<p>Things do improve as you get older. The teasing stops (mostly) 
as it becomes socially unacceptable to mock someone for their 
appearance or weight. But in some ways, this makes it harder 
to cope with. You know people are judging you and treating 
you differently in subtle ways, but since they're nice about it, 
it's harder to just ignore them or put up walls.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
People are simply nicer to attractive women. If you go out </p>
<p>with a cute friend, you can see this painfully clearly. This 
isn't to say that people are mean to unattractive women; 
they aren't. It's more like you're invisible.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You can't shop at a lot of normal stores. Many don't carry 
plus-sizes, so you have to go to special stores for larger 
women.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You don't get hit on, you don't get people asking for your 
number, you don't get people buying you drinks, you don't 
get much attention of any kind really.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> You date online, and you get used to people telling you 
they just aren't attracted to you.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
It's easier to be platonic friends with men because there's 
little chance they'll end up sexually or romantically interested in you.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You get used to people giving you unsolicited advice about 
your health and/or appearance. If you're fat or ugly, you 
just aren't working hard enough at being otherwise.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
You either feel ashamed of how you look or you learn to 
not care.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 People don't take pictures of you. Honestly. I know it 
sounds weird, but I have very few pictures of myself from 
the time when I was seriously overweight. </p>
the good
<p>While it can be extremely traumatic to go through the experiences I've described here, there is actually a silver lining to it 
all. Attractive women are treated well primarily because we as 
a society objectify them. In a way, you get to dodge that bullet. 
It hurts to feel invisible to the world, but it's also liberating. 
You are free to simply exist as a person, and if you are able 
to make the most of that, it can be a great opportunity for 
spiritual growth.</p>
<p>The other big upside is that you have likely developed a 
good personality and/or career in order to cope with the social downsides of being unattractive. Combine this with the 
fact that age, money, and time can go a long way towards 
making you more attractive, and you will almost certainly end 
up at an advantage later on in your life.</p>
natural beauty fades, of course, but intelligence, empathy, 
wit, and kindness last forever.<br/>

<h3>pick-up artists</h3>
<b><h2>Why are women so negative about 
the &ldquo;picking up women&rdquo; school of 
thought?</h2>
Gayle Laakmann McDowell, I read things<br/>
I became negative about it because of what I saw it do to 
guys.</b>
<p>When I first learned about it, I was mostly just intrigued. 
I ended up learning a bunch about it. I read <i>The Game</i> (which 
I still think is a really interesting book) and ended up meeting 
a lot of people who were in the Pick-up Artist (PUA) Community (not a goal &mdash; it just happened).</p>
<p>I even ended up helping out with one of their weekend 
seminars, to be a "female test dummy" essentially. Far from 
the stereotype of sleazy guys who want one night stands, 24 
of the 25 guys in the class were just awkward, nerdy guys who 
just wanted a girlfriend (the 25th wanted to bring home a 
girl for a threesome with his girlfriend). But that's not the 
instruction of these classes. The classes are about <i>getting laid</i>, 
not getting a girlfriend.</p>
<p><b>This was my first big hint that something was wrong</b>
. 
There was a mismatch. They were taking guys who wanted 
girlfriends and teaching them how to pick up girls in bars. 
How many relationships do you know of that started in bars? 
Do you know<i> any</i>? If you want a girlfriend, go sign up for an 
online dating site. Start dating! Statistically speaking, bars 
don't work.<br/>
<b>And then there was the instruction itself</b>. </p>
<p>The problem is that what works for one person doesn't 
work for everyone &mdash; not all guys, and not on all girls. They 
were telling guys things like:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Touch a girl when she talks to you. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Criticize a girl (sorry, I mean "neg").<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
When a girl seems uninterested, she's just playing games.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Don't talk about "real" topics, like education and your job. 
They're too "boring."<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
no woman is out of your league.
<p>The problem here is that touching 
<i>can</i> be flirty, but it can 
also be really creepy when the touching isn't natural. And 
when you're telling an awkward, nerdy guy who has no idea 
how to flirt "okay, now, touch a girl here," it's almost always 
creepy. (Personally, I <i>don't </i>like random guys at bars touching 
me. It makes me really uncomfortable.)</p>
<p>And then you're telling the guy to criticize the girl, which 
is just plain mean. <br/>
And then, when the girl isn't interested, the guy is now 
being told, "oh, she's just trying to play games with you." <i>He
doesn't back off. </i>eww.<br/>
And all of this is ridiculous because sometimes, the girl <i>is</i>
out of your league, or at least just isn't interested. I'm 5'9 and 
I'm just not going to go home with a guy who is 5'3, goes by 
the nickname "Snake" (seriously?!?), overweight, pimply, and 
won't just answer a direct question about what he does for a 
living. But he keeps pursuing because, well, "I'm just playing 
games with him." I'm trying to see if he passes some test, apparently.<br/>
These are the sort of repeated interactions I had with guys 
in the PUA community, and why I got turned against it. once 
upon a time, this guy might have been a perfectly normal but 
nerdy guy, who could have dated online, met someone nice, 
got married, and been perfectly happy.<br/>
<b>PUA instruction turns awkward, nerdy guys who just 
want a girlfriend into creepy guys who harass and insult 
women</b>. And that's not okay!<br/>
PUA instruction teaches guys these mechanical ways of 
interacting with women which don't really work and totally 
fails to recognize that every woman is different. Some women 
just won't go home with you. Sorry. Maybe it's because she's 
out of your league. or maybe she's just not interested in you. 
or maybe she just doesn't go home with random dudes from 
bars.<br/>
The words coming out of a women's mouth? It's not all 
a game. You can have actual conversations with us. When I 
say, "What do you do for a living?" it's because I actually care. 
Because I'm looking for someone to build a relationship with, 
and someone with no career goals is not a good match for me. 
<i>Answer the question.</i><br/>
Conversation is not all a giant game. When I'm not interested, it's because I'm not interested. not because I'm putting 
some sort of girl test in front of you. <br/>
<b>So that's why I'm against it. Because, beyond just giving men the courage to approach women, the instruction is 
harmful to the guys.</b><br/>
Some of my friends who were involved in the community got out of it okay, but they were probably more normally 
adjusted to start with. Another friend, well, he got his taste 
of one night stands and "can't understand the point of girlfriend." And other guys I've met are so uncomfortable to be 
around that, well, we never really became friends.</p>

<h3>attractiveness</h3>
<b><h2>As a young woman, how can I 
shake the feeling that being goodlooking is the primary thing that 
males will acknowledge and praise 
my existence for?</h2>
Shannon Larson, I think a radical feminist viewpoint adds 
value to many discussions.
<p>Your concern is justified. You cannot shake that feeling because it is, to a large degree, correct. You can, however, take 
steps to drown it out.</p></b>
<p><b>Male attention is natural, but it's only because our society was built and is still structured as a patriarchy that the 
lust factor is what defines a woman's worth, <i>not just romantically, but often socially and economically, as well</i></b>.</p>
<p>We are living a man's world. Its institutions are built according to men's priorities. That's why being good-looking is 
so important for females.</p>
<p>There have been cultures where women are used as currency. That's in our cultural DnA. Trafficking of women and 
girls is a current problem in the US. Attractive women literally have high economic worth, as a commodity.</p>
<p>The one thing that men have in common is a desire for 
women (unless they're gay or asexual, in which case for much 
of recent history they were under extreme pressure to suck 
it up and still wed and impregnate women, which probably 
made them angry, bitter, and resentful, which is probably 
even worse for women). That is a major basis of male camaraderie.</p>
<p>Men rule the institutions of this world. Being acknowledged and praised by men is very important. It's often how 
you're hired and promoted. You can't just shake off how men 
view you. That's how entrenched power views you.</p>
<p>This is why qualifying as an object for male lust is so important to your success. In a world structured by men's preferences, one of the easiest ways to succeed is by adhering to 
those preferences, gaining their favor, holding their attention, thereby lessening the annoyance of a woman encroaching on male territory.</p>
<p>A handful of enlightened men doesn't outweigh the majority, who don't work to change the system in the name of 
altruism, especially since that would expose themselves to 
more competition. That's too selfless to be universally practiced. That effort that can better be spent advancing their own 
career.</p>
<p>everyone, male and female alike, is indoctrinated into the 
male-centered paradigm.<br/>
<b>As a girl, how many times were you told that you were 
"beautiful," by your mother and father or by male and female strangers? How many times was your brother praised 
so highly for his appearance? </b>Instead of receiving beauty 
praise, how many times did people compliment you as "smart" 
or "hard-working"? Were you told that you're going to have 
to "fight off the boys" or that you'll support a family one day?<br/>
This is how you were trained to expect praise primarily for 
your appearance.<br/>
Miss America is judged on dazzling smiles and good looks. 
This beauty is innate value that cannot be easily altered and 
steadily degrades over time. By contrast, Mr. Universe (which 
doesn't have anything close to the same audience) is about 
muscles, which can be judged more objectively and which 
men have to work hard to get and can build over time.<br/>
This is how you were trained to evaluate other women by 
their appearance.<br/>
A female's looks are what matters, and their grading is 
subjective. no woman can be entirely confident that she is 
attractive to every man. She has to stay on her toes, working to continually improve her beauty while nature steadily 
undermines it.<br/>
Women decline in value as they age, "losing their figure." 
Professional accomplishments rarely outweigh a sagging butt. 
A mark of success is a wife who does Pilates, not a wife with 
a high-powered career.<br/>
<b>A woman should have a "great figure" and a "great ass." 
This is often how she gets approval from females, as well as 
males.</b><br/>
Hot-or-not is how we are taught to evaluate women. There 
are individual exceptions, but the herd mentality is to value 
hotness above all else. It is the primary way society judges 
women.<br/>
For example, a woman having a "great personality" is 
slang for being undesirable. no man is congratulated for having a girlfriend/wife with a "great personality."<br/>
<b>It is impossible for a woman to be praised for having a 
"great personality."</b><br/>
For a sad honest picture of society, ask a sweet, smart, 
funny, heavy woman about her love life.<br/>
Then consider the fact that in my high school, there was 
a girl who abused laxatives over the summer to lose a lot of 
weight. everyone knew this, but she looked hot. Her dating 
life took off. Hotness outweighs bulimia.</p>
<p><b>Enough with the problem. Let's look at solutions:</b>
You need to live much of your life in an echo chamber of <br/>
positive messages.<br/>
<b>Stop consuming mainstream culture.</b><br/>
Turn off the TV. Rarely watch movies. Don't listen to pop <br/>
music. Don't read magazines. once you start paying close attention to how women are portrayed, these media will lose <br/>
much of their appeal, anyway. There is a clear message that <br/>
hotness is a woman's primary worth.<br/>
one of the greatest tragedies of American (and increasingly so, global) society is the fact that our culture is manufactured by lovers of buxom, bronzed, Botoxed, bottle-blonde <br/>
bimbos. (even if women are intelligent, they won't be rewarded for displaying it. It's irrelevant that Shakira is in MenSA.)
Hollywood is the most extreme example of praising females almost exclusively for their looks. A female can earn an <br/>
acting award, but extreme hotness is a prerequisite to even <br/>
being considered.<br/>
<b>Build your social world around common-interest niches.</b>
There is a broad spectrum of how much emphasis people <br/>
place on attractiveness, so on a personal level, you have hopes <br/>
of finding a respectful partner and true friends who value you <br/>
for who you are, not how you look.<br/>
Make friends with gamers. Make friends on Quora. Make <br/>
friends organizing a project you feel passionate about. Join a <br/>
book group.<br/>
You could also step off into a counterculture. Looks won't <br/>
become unimportant, but there will be a better balance. Creativity and intellectual depth are what will get you praise from <br/>
everyone.<br/>
<b>Don't compare your looks to other women.</b><br/>
This is a competition in which we all lose. Beauty is subjective. There will always be someone more beautiful than <br/>
you, and in someone else's eyes, there will always be someone <br/>
more beautiful than she.<br/>
There will always be women, like Helen Mirren, who look <br/>
amazing as they age, and if you consider them the competition, you will feel like a loser.<br/>
<b>Don't hang out with vain women.</b><br/>
Limit your conversations about clothes, jewelry, makeup, <br/>
etc. Don't talk to people who sound like <i>Cosmo</i>. Don't gossip <br/>
about other people's love lives.<br/>
<b>Date a man who calls you smart/determined/whateverpositive-adjective-applies-to-you way more than he calls you <br/>
beautiful/pretty/hot.</b><br/>
This problem goes far beyond dating, but this is a great <br/>
place to start.<br/>
<b>Find female mentors, especially ones old enough to have <br/>
degraded in fertility appeal.</b><br/>
The majority of the workforce is still male-dominated. You <br/>
need someone to turn to when you realize you didn't get invited to a meeting because the salesman who called it spent <br/>
half the time talking about sleeping with women.<br/>
<b>Don't work too hard on a "perfect" appearance.</b>
Dress to express something other than a desire for beauty. <br/>
Dress to be professional, fun, crazy, artsy, comfortable, sporty, <br/>
classy. Pay homage to a certain place, time, person, or film. <br/>
Don't necessarily focus on hotness, which will come along <br/>
with confidence and happiness anyway.<br/>
Don't worry if something isn't super-flattering if you love <br/>
it. I have this bright, colorful full skirt that doesn't flatter my <br/>
wide hips but looks amazing blowing in the wind. That's my <br/>
favorite thing to wear.<br/>
Focus on flattering your coloring, which will stay constant, instead of wearing shorts with words that draw atten<br/>
tion to your perky butt, which you will lose.<br/>
When you work out, focus on getting stronger and healthier, not hotter.<br/>
Don't worry about making yourself look flawless with <br/>
makeup. everyone has flaws. If you still want to wear makeup, play up your favorite features and experiment with color.
<b>Shrug off comments on your appearance.</b><br/>
A stranger saying, "Hi, gorgeous," doesn't matter. Don't <br/>
act like it does. Since you do have to process it, interpret it as <br/>
meaning you look happy today.<br/>
<b>Be aware of negative stereotypes of women and don't exhibit them around male colleagues.</b><br/>
Masculinity is strong, and femininity is weak. Those are <br/>
the house rules. Don't undermine your professional image <br/>
with the power brokers. Maintain your non-beauty value.
<b>Work to succeed according to your own values.</b>
That's how you circumvent the house rules.<br/>
Mother Teresa didn't have to be hot.<br/>
The bad news is that you're not going to be able to change <br/>
the broader picture, and you will not be able to totally shake <br/>
this feeling because that is the way the world is.<br/>
When you're featured in an article on female gamers, the <br/>
number one question many men will have is whether you're <br/>
hot. When you're walking down the road, men will evaluate <br/>
your ass when they drive by and let you know if you passed <br/>
their lust assessment. Those are experiences you can't avoid.
You've just got to write them off as haters (woman-haters, <br/>
to be more specific) and rise above it.</p>

<h3>women in technology</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be a woman 
working in the tech industry?</h2>
Rebekah Cox, I've been working since I was 15.</b>
<p><b>Being a woman in the tech industry is awesome if you love 
technology enough to push through the more difficult parts.</b>
Right off the bat, a disclaimer: It's very difficult to answer 
this question broadly. not all experiences are the same. However, I can share my personal experience because it might 
contribute to some larger themes. So, here's my answer . . . an 
answer from a product designer who has spent over a decade 
building products and has spent the last four years building 
products and managing people in Silicon Valley[1].</p>
act 1 - unfortunate reality
<p><b>The Environment Is Generally Rough</b><br/>
Girls are raised differently than boys. not all girls and not all 
boys are raised the same, obviously, but on average, girls are 
more sheltered than boys in their formative years. Girls are 
typically raised with kid gloves and rarely receive the hard, 
direct, and tough feedback of their male counterparts. This 
is important because the technical environment is tough and 
has been built on a foundation of direct feedback, and there 
are very established and elaborate structures that facilitate 
nerd trash talk. So, if you enter this environment as a woman 
without any sort of agenda or understanding of this culture, 
the first thing you find is that if you actually say something, 
the most likely reaction is for a guy to verbally hit you directly 
in the face. To the guys, this is perfectly normal, expected, 
and encouraged behavior, but to women this is completely out 
of nowhere and extremely discouraging. </p>
<p>As a technical woman, this is your introduction, and the 
first thing you have to learn is how to get back up and walk 
right back into a situation where the likelihood of getting 
punished for participating is one. How you choose to react 
to this[2] determines the rest of your career in technology. If 
it's too painful, you'll retreat to management, if you can tough 
it out, your career will be limited because the very tools you 
develop to survive have other social consequences[3].</p>
<p><b>You Generally Feel Alone</b><br/>
Because the environment is so rough and generally hostile, the 
women who can navigate it are a very small, select group[4]. 
It's rare to encounter another woman and even rarer to encounter another technical woman.</p>
<p>overall, it's awesome to encounter other women because 
while you grow accustomed to quirks of a room full of men 
(the jostling, the chest beating, the pissing contests, the egos, 
etc.), it does get old. When another woman is thrown into 
that mix, you get to avoid the old script and reevaluate the 
dynamic so it's more interesting. However, you and everyone 
else is accustomed to women in the facilitator manager role, 
not in the making technical decisions role. Typically your collaborative and directional contributions almost always fare 
better than your technical contributions. If you pay attention 
to those social cues, you may start to subtly pull yourself out of 
the rough and tumble technical decision making and retreat 
into the facilitation role. If you ignore the social cues, you 
have to assert yourself aggressively into the technical conversation[5] and take some lumps. If you choose that aggressive 
path, you will be even more alone because those likely less 
technical women in the room with you don't have the expertise to back you up.</p>
act ii - fortunate reality
<p><b>You Have Access to Opportunities (You Are NOT Actually 
Alone)</b><br/>
even the aforementioned nerd trash talk is actually a useful 
tool that can help you. The reason that culture exists is to 
make everyone in the group better. The fact that you are getting hit in the face means that someone is either wrong, and 
you can hit back with a correct answer or that you are wrong 
and someone is letting you know that directly. Sticking that 
out means you are learning in an accelerated environment 
with instant correction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you stick around long enough, you can 
find people who aren't completely insecure and are confident 
enough to not resort to insults to assert themselves. Those 
people make the tough environment actually tolerable. If you 
can help each other, then you can establish a safer zone to 
talk through ideas. And since those more secure people are 
typically so secure because they are really, really good, you can 
find yourself in an informational jet-stream.</p>
<p>opportunities also exist in the form of help from others 
pushing you forward and help in the form of others who don't 
let you get away with anything. Help might be treating you 
like everyone else. Help might be from the powerful women 
who may not make the perfect guidepost but are available 
and will make time for you. For me personally, a huge turning point was working at Quora. I remember realizing how 
the founders had trusted me with this incredible challenge involved with taking responsibility for building Quora's product 
and interface. It was the first time I was able to take responsibility directly, which is a remarkable opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Results Matter and Are Powerful</b><br/>
The technology world isn't a perfect meritocracy, but it's close 
enough and awesome results do matter. Whatever barrier is 
in front of you, an amazing product that gets traction will 
cut through it. The same is true for an awesome abstraction 
that boasts a 50% speed improvement or generates elegant 
code that enables future efficiency. The absence of an outright 
block means that making something great can open many 
closed doors. Just knowing that is possible is very encouraging. Additionally, if you push through the crap and have major 
contributions to make, no one is going to be able to ignore 
your results, nor will they want to. At the end of the day, everyone in technology wants to turn a dollar into ten and then 
into a thousand; it's essentially a culture built on hope and 
results. The barriers to entry are pretty low and inexpensive. 
Start building, learn JavaScript, publish thoughts, all of these 
building blocks are readily accessible. Use them. Get results. 
People will give you money to get more results.</p>
<p><b>Being a Woman in Tech Is a Competitive Advantage</b>
Developing new technologies is about oscillating from extreme focus (for designing and programming and building) to 
wide open creative exploration (in order to understand people 
and their motivations as well as their problems). As a woman 
thinking about these complex issues, you have a rich and deep 
understanding around details like safety and privacy but also 
around tone and cooperative communication and gathering 
feedback. You also have this ability to obsess about the details[6] others may ignorantly avoid. That's not even the faintest outline of the unique characteristics women bring. When 
half of all consumers are women, being able to tap into those 
women to use your product is obviously huge. not enough 
women capitalize on this advantage, but that doesn't make it 
less meaningful.</p>
act iii - conclusion
<p><b>Technology Is Awesome</b><br/>
Being a woman in technology means being surrounded by 
amazing technology and crazy smart and ambitious people <i>all 
the time</i>. Being a technical woman means being able to join 
in on the fun and building things for people as a path toward 
making their lives better. How awesome is that?</p>
<p><font size="-1">[1]</font>
 Additional context: There are a lot of overlapping yet ultimately distinct cultures in SV right now. There is the 
founder culture and within that there are established 
founders and so-called founders of products that are even 
more likely to fail. There are run-of-the-mill engineers 
and so-called 10x engineers. There are designers and 
product managers, each with its own 10x variety. There 
are people who speak at conferences and are good at promoting themselves and there are people who are actually 
extremely talented and fly under the radar completely.</p>
<p>on top of that there's what the press cares about and 
the press cares about founders and sometimes managers. There are precious few women founders, and of that 
small subset, they are generally not <b>established</b> founders 
with proven successes who are also technical. (I can only 
think of one woman who has founded a company that had 
a chance of succeeding, and she's amazing and talented 
and impressive but not technical.) As a result, most articles that are written about women are almost always 
exclusively about women in tech who are managers (product or professional), not specifically technical women. </p>
<p>So you read about these managers, but then you also 
read these regular calls for more women in tech and how 
none exist and you look around thinking, "Hello! Right 
here! C'mon! WTF?" now, to be fair, sometimes the women written about are also somewhat technical in that they 
have taken CS classes but anyone who is actively technical 
knows that a few CS classes are not the same as being in 
the trenches and building a product hands-on. This context 
is important, because as a technical woman, you are looking for something to cling to and determine how you fit in 
to the larger ecosystem. But because the larger ecosystem 
is nearly totally empty when it comes to role models, you 
have to look either at men or closer to home at the women 
in your immediate vicinity who are probably not technical.</p>
<p>The women who are actually ambitious enough to potentially make it in tech as technical women look at this 
landscape and every signal derails her from that technical path because the vicious cycle encourages her to chase 
only the most viable channels. Chief among them: management.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[2]</font>
 If you are lucky, you will encounter people (men and women) who are caring enough to help you in deal with this in 
exactly two ways: i) They encourage you to keep going and 
ii) they hold you to the same high standard as everyone 
else. If you are unlucky, you will encounter people (men 
and women) who validate your worst fears and allow you 
to give up.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[3]</font>
 There's another dimension, which is the girls club versus 
boys club which is situated on top of this mess. The girls 
club is very different than the boys club. entirely different rules apply and if you've spent any amount of time 
optimizing to fit into the boys club, it will not transfer 
to the girls club. The girls club is full of managers, not 
engineers. Users, not builders. All the tools that allow 
you to survive the boys club as a technical woman become 
these huge liabilities in the girls club. You are seen as too 
rough, too aloof, and too disinterested (because you actually probably are). In my case, I am also seen as having far 
too many sharp edges, being too mean, etc. That's all true 
but not without purpose. </p>
<p><font size="-1">[4]</font>
 You're also constantly looking to other women for someone to model yourself after. Because the set of available 
candidates is so limited, it's really hard to find someone 
you feel comfortable with having as a guidepost. So, you 
basically either choose a man to model after or cobble 
something together from fragments of women. A frankinmodel is usually always bad because the traits that make a 
product or professional manager successful are different 
from those that make a technical founder successful.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[5]</font>
 The worst part for me personally was a stage where 
I was behind. I didn't touch a computer until I was 
in college. My male counterparts, however, had been 
programming actively for years before I even navigated the filesystem. But there is something far more 
treacherous than losing from being behind: it's not being considered a competitor. When you are strapped 
with low expectations, it's easy for you to start believing those are true. People are also sometimes quick to 
validate your low expectations and even performance.</p>
<p>In college, I had this racquetball class. The first thing 
the coach did was divide the group into boys and girls. The 
boys played against other boys and girls played against 
other girls. After a few weeks of this arrangement, I 
was destroying the other girls. eventually, the coach allowed me to play against the guys and even the worst guy 
promptly destroyed me. They hit the ball way harder than 
the girls and the play was very physical and intimidating. 
on the final day of class in the final match, I lost by only 
a couple points. By that time, I had finally started to hone 
a new strategy: I couldn't compete on speed or power, so I 
competed on finesse. That meant skating the ball along a 
wall and giving the guys less of an opportunity to hit the 
ball with any amount of power. I felt pretty good about 
getting to that point, but upset that I didn't have an entire 
term of play at the guy's level. Had I started earlier and 
had my competition been tougher, I bet I would have won 
a few.<br/>
<font size="-1">[6]</font> I have this trick where if I start to obsess about something </p>
<p>that doesn't actually matter, I'll try to divert that attention 
to obsessing about something to make the product better. 
That obsession breeds focus, and when directed productively toward real problems, awesome results can sometimes be generated.</p>

<h3>women in technology</h3>
<b><h2>What advice would seasoned 
women in tech give to younger girls 
deciding to make a tech career for 
themselves?</h2>
Nora Mullaney, Software Engineer at Facebook</b>
<p>Working in the tech industry is awesome. You get to go out 
and build the future every day. In spite of what you might 
think, giving the paucity of females in tech, it's a pretty good 
place for women to work:</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
It's got one of the smallest income gender gaps (I believe 
it's about 96% vs. an average of 70%).<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The pay is generous (at least for software engineers).<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> It tends to be relatively flexible, in terms of when you 
work.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
It's very easy to work remotely.
<p>Another great thing about working in technology is that it's 
very easy to mix in other interests. If you are passionate about 
music or sports or biology or charity, you are likely to be able 
to find a tech company that's working in that space.
<b>Advice</b> (which mostly applies to both genders):</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
The best way to learn in the tech field is to jump in and 
build things, so you should go ahead and do that as much 
as possible.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Don't be intimidated by those who seem to know more 
than you. It's very easy to techno-babble at someone and 
seem intelligent. never be afraid to ask questions if you 
don't understand something. It's a great way to learn. If 
the person you ask can't/won't explain, it's likely he/she 
doesn't really understand.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Sadly, you will likely run into some sexism. Don't let it 
get you down. one of the nice things about engineering 
is that you can usually prove an idea is better by building 
it. Don't be afraid to ignore nay-sayers and just go for it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Choose your environments/companies well. They may 
vary a lot in how things are run. I prefer meritocracies, 
for avoiding sexism and experience-ism. Web companies 
are fun because they usually have a very fast release cycle. 
The most important thing is to work on something that 
you're interested in and passionate about.</p>

<h2>THe UnITeD STATeS</h2>
<h3>9/11</h3>
<b><h2>What did it feel like to be inside the 
World Trade Center at the time of 
the 9/11 attacks?</h2>
Ashton Lee, world's crossroad</b><br/>
I was living and working at the World Trade Center on that 
day, and this is what I remember.
<p>I was a consultant at the time, and my office was in Tower 
Two on the 43rd floor. I had a meeting that morning that was 
cancelled just the night before. When the first plane struck, 
I was on the 18th floor, not yet at my office, and I remember looking at a nearby digital clock that read 8:46am. You 
could feel the building shake, and it was scary, not because 
the building moved, but to the degree that it did. I was used 
to working on the higher floors of both towers, and the Twin 
Towers were made to sway and move ever so slightly. You 
could sometimes feel it just a little during periods of heavy 
wind.</p>
<p>But this time it was different. This was not caused by 
wind; it was a sudden jolt. I looked outside the window and 
saw what I thought was a piece of metal flying by. My heart 
and my mind raced. Strange to say this now, but I felt VeRY 
ALIVe, while a deep and sudden fear also crept over me.</p>
<p>Fear was soon replaced by a driving need to act. My body 
was full of adrenaline, and my mind was factoring over different scenarios within what must have been a few eye blinks. 
I recalled seeing a cable show a few weeks back that talked 
about how the towers were built, their structural make up, 
and particularly their height. I recalled the narrative saying 
the buildings were so tall that if they were to tip over, it would 
hit or shake new Jersey, I don't recall the exact words, but 
the meaning stuck with me. It became a dominant thought 
in my head.</p>
<p>I ran for the stairs. I was not the only one. I could hear 
someone shout that there was a fire. It became very crowded, 
but the exit at this early time was still orderly. </p>
<p>A small crowd started congregating outside the Marriott 
WTC, which was situated right between the two main towers 
of the World Trade Center area connecting the two buildings. 
People were dismayed and trying to figure out what was going on. Across the street was the Hudson River. My mind was 
still in worst case scenario mode; I thought if anything really 
happened to the buildings here it would be safer by the water 
than close to the buildings, and I imagined myself jumping in 
to prepare myself mentally. </p>
<p>I looked around, people were not moving. even worse, 
joggers and nearby pedestrians were heading ToWARD the 
buildings to see what the commotion was about. I thought, 
this is madness!</p>
<p>I shouted as loud as I could, "If this building falls it will hit 
new Jersey! Run!" A lady screamed. I then started running 
toward the waters of the Hudson alongside northern Battery 
Park, and others did too. I just wanted to get away far enough 
to assess the situation from a position of safety. </p>
<p>And I kept running. Looking back, I could see dark smoke 
start to form; it wasn't a good sign. The fear came back, but 
so did the need to act. It was still early, and the mobile phone 
networks had not yet jammed up. I called my sister to let her 
know that I was ok, that she may see new York in the news, 
but that I was not in the towers, more importantly that I loved 
everyone and that she should relay this message to our family 
members and especially my mom. </p>
<p>I needed to get off the island, that was my dominant 
thought. I headed toward Chelsea Piers, to the ferries I knew 
were there. Still seeing more people heading toward the commotion, I yelled at them, that I just came from there, and that 
they were headed in the wrong direction. Madness.</p>
<p>When I got to the ferries, I ran into another friend of 
mine who ran over from midtown, Times Square. We were 
there early enough where people had not caught up with what 
was going on, we still had to wait in line and pay for the ferry 
crossing.</p>
<p>I was on the ferry in the Hudson River when the first 
tower fell . . . It was gut-wrenching and surreal. The darkness 
of the smoke started to envelop the sky. People were crying, 
trying to call their loved ones, asking questions. A friend of 
mine would recall to me getting out of the subway stop for the 
WTC after 9am, while I was still running. He told me it was 
an image out of hell. He could see people jumping out of the 
buildings, everywhere there was a mad scramble by that time 
to get out. I can't fully fathom what his experience must have 
been like nor would I want to.</p>
<p>Was our country being attacked? no one knew. My friend 
and I decided that we needed to go somewhere far away, 
away from big buildings but with solid communication networks, and food supplies. His girlfriend at the time went to 
Yale University, and I thought there was a certain degree of 
safety within a closed area like a university in a small town. 
So that became our destination. Close enough to reach yet, 
far enough to regroup.</p>
<p>When we reached Jersey, we found a private car. She 
charged us 300USD or so, cash only. I went to the ATM, 
came back, and paid. As we drove further north, the skyline 
behind us became more and more enveloped in black smoke. 
It was like a scene out of a movie, that's what I was thinking. 
Phone lines were jammed up by this time. I would later reconnect with family and friends over email from the Yale campus. 
I turned on the news.</p>
The world, our world, my own world; nothing would ever 
quite be the same.<br/>

<h3>asian americans</h3>
<b><h2>What does it mean to be Asian 
American?</h2>
Marq Hwang, the Ill-informed</b><br/>
Like all stories about Americans, it's kind of long. It's kind of 
confusedly muddled. It's kind of wonderful.
<p><b>It's a story about loss, about disconnection</b>
.<br/>
Traditions are the first to go. Born here, raised here, half a 
world away, your parents try to keep as many as they can, 
but it's a losing battle. What holiday is this? <b>&#52628;&#49437;</b>? Well, we're 
not going over there. Mom's too tired to make the traditional 
foods, whatever they are, so let's just go out to dinner. Maybe 
call <b>&#54624;&#47672;&#45768;</b>. Then, later in the year, maybe the next, you fly 
home, across the Great Flat ocean, and you visit the shrine 
of your ancestors. How many <b>&#51208;</b> do I do? Am I even doing 
it right? Am I spelling it right? My knees are getting tired. 
Why prostrate myself to these ancestors I've never met, whose 
gaze of my life is so distant, clouded by time and space, whose 
memory I can't even conjure?</p>
<p>The language is the next to go. You have a fight with your 
mom about going to homecoming. You want to go. You don't 
know why, exactly, since you don't care much for the football 
team. You're angry all the time. Angry because they get all the 
funding. Angry because all the 'traditions' that come so naturally to others, you don't know about. Angry because the white 
girl you kinda like and want to go with can trace her family 
back to the first settlers, and you don't know anything past the 
hint that your grandfather might have been in the Resistance. 
Angry because of hormones. Your mom yells at you, demanding you study. That you stay home and spend time with your 
visiting relatives. She shouts in Korean at you. And instead of 
shouting back in Korean, you yell back in english. You slam 
the door to your room, cursing in english. Years later, in a 
college class you picked because you thought it would be cake, 
you realize the only Korean you know comes from the few 
movies you watch, what you learned at home, and how you 
order at restaurants. You barely pass.</p>
<p>The ties are the last to go. You rarely speak to your relatives unless you visit or call, the distance becoming more than 
just geographical. You try to keep up with them on Facebook, 
but you hide parts of your life because you don't know how 
they'd react. even your mom gets in on the gig, saying that it 
would be best if they didn't know some things. You dream of 
living back in your ancestral homeland, but reality reminds 
you that it would probably only be fun for a little while, before 
you want to come home, here, to the Americas.</p>
<p><b>It's a story about gain, about building.</b><br/>
When your roots are loose, the first thing you do is to put new 
ones down. You end up in a place you find rather agreeable. 
You make friends, build your own 'extended' family. You let 
your best friends' families 'adopt' you, and you bring your own 
to their Thanksgivings, their Christmases, their Seders. You 
get hurt when these friends move away, but you eventually 
realize that wherever they settle, you have carte blanche to 
visit them, to make new roots someplace new.</p>
<p>When your knowledge of your ancestral culture is fractured, the first thing you do is try to create one. You do this 
by voraciously reading up on your own. You still don't remember all the details, but you go through the motions, hoping 
that there's some meaning there. You read up on others', and 
you discover ones that you never knew existed. You fall in 
with the nerds, the punks, the gays, the outcasts. You pick 
up their slang, their argot, their mannerisms. You move on, 
sometimes, after you get bored, but they're always a part of 
you, and you make your own.</p>
<p>And when your traditions are hazy and gone, you make 
new ones. Your Christmases are now spent with your family, watching bad movies like <i>Jingle All the Way</i>. You always 
block time out at the major holidays to visit your best friends. 
When you're sick, you always order out from that same Korean restaurant that makes <b>&#51692;&#48981;</b>. Is that what your relatives 
eat when they're feeling sick? no? You don't care. It makes 
you feel better. every birthday, you invite your friends out to 
a Korean restaurant, and put what little Korean you still remember to good use, and on theirs, you learn how to wrap 
gifts in &#39080;&#21570;&#25975;. It's Japanese, actually, but you don't care, and 
neither do they &mdash; it's elegant, and beautiful.</p>
<p><b>It's a story about bridges, about synthesis.</b><br/>
At potlucks, you're the one everyone's curious about. You 
bring dishes that are usually a little bit interesting, outside 
of the norm. Risotto, but what's that flavor? You used miso 
as the broth? Amazing. These dumplings? Chorizo and scallions? Wow. They come to you after hearing about the Korean taco stands, and you go together, to everyone's enjoyment. You hear about this amazing ph&#7903; place, or a brand new 
place that serves fufu and melon seed soup, and you drag your 
friends along.</p>
<p>Sometimes you answer questions. What exactly is that 
Gangnam Style he's singing about? Why is the north so 
weird? Is the internet there really better? And even though 
you preface your answers with a little bit of uncertainty, you 
muddle through. They're just as interested as you are, maybe 
more so. But you're interested in what your Romanian friends' 
experiences were when Ceau&#537;escu fell, and you ask. You want 
to know what your friends from Zimbabwe eat. You want to 
see this 'Austin' that your Texan friends rave about. And everyone understands each other more.</p>
<p>You've flitted in and out of various subcultures and groups. 
Your facility with english is top-notch. You've experienced all 
these new things now, sampled from various plates and listened to all sorts of songs. So you take all these things home 
with you; you take your mama out all night, and you show her 
all these things you've done, that you've learned. You see her 
eyes open, like Sokath's, and she understands this place in a 
new way, a way she never has, as a native, as an American.</p>
<p><b>It's a story, like every other story.</b><br/>
When I first sat down to write this, I thought a little bit about 
writing about the little things that trip one up every day. The 
assumption that we're foreigners. The stereotypes and the suspicion that hangs over us whether we pretend to ignore it or 
not.</p>
<p>But that's not the story. That's not what it means to be 
Asian American. To be Asian American, you start to realize that you put more and more of yourself in the American 
category, and you view the Asian as a slight spin, like Irish, 
newyorican, German. You know that while you could pass in 
the old country, for a little while, you grew up with a few too 
many cheeseburgers and cokes, a taste for grits, and a soft
spot for Country Pop that you keep deep in the closet, deeper, 
probably, than the affection you have for really bad action 
movies like <i>The Expendables</i>. You know you're too loud, abrasive, and obnoxious to be anything but American, too proud, 
and maybe even a too little knee-jerk patriotic. You can talk 
shit about America, because it's yours. Those people in other 
countries can't.</p>
<p>And you know that no matter how others see you, it doesn't 
really matter. Your blood might have come from overseas, but 
your heart started beating here.</p>

<h3>new york city</h3>
<b><h2>Why is NYC so great?</h2>
Matt Schiavenza, Live it and love it</b>
<p>Where to start? As someone who grew up elsewhere and has 
lived and traveled on three continents, I can attest that new 
York is indeed a wonderfully special place. Here's why:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>New York is the quintessential urban experience in our 
contemporary world.</b> A century ago, it was London. A century from now, it could well be Shanghai or Mumbai, Sao 
Paolo or Lagos. But new York, for our time and place, is 
the world's capital. While this may seem a spurious reason to vouch for a city's greatness, new York's role as the 
"center of the world" is something you can almost feel. The 
political, financial, and cultural institutions based in this 
city attract talented and ambitious people from all over 
the world. (And would attract even more if the US had a 
sensible immigration policy, but I digress . . . ) In no other 
place I can think of, save London, can you find people at 
the pinnacle of their profession in such a small geographical radius. It's an extraordinary privilege to be so close to 
so many interesting people.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>The density and the diversity. </b>new York City is, by far, the 
densest city in the United States &mdash; and that includes the 
outer boroughs. Manhattan alone is one of the densest urban areas in the world, especially in the developed world. 
(The only comparable place I've been in the so-called 'first 
world' is Hong Kong, which is a whole other story). People 
think of Manhattan as a rich person's territory &mdash; justifiably &mdash; but bear in mind that there's Harlem, and Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights, as well as a 
multitude of areas with a lot of working-class and middle-class people. Because of this geographic compression 
and a flat-rate subway, new York's various populations 
mix and mingle more than those in many other cities. In 
Los Angeles, the wealthy of Beverly Hills do not identify 
with the poor of Compton. In new York, both the wealthy 
and the poor recognize each others as part of the same 
basic polity. As a result, despite the extraordinary wealth 
and snobbery you can encounter in new York, people are 
more tolerant of others simply due to the incredible density. Is there still bigotry? of course. But new Yorkers, to 
me, treat each other better than almost anyone else I've 
ever met. Laugh all you want, but I believe it completely.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> The range of occupations</b>. I grew up in the Bay Area, 
which I still regard as America's most beautiful and livable metropolitan area. But culturally, the Bay Area is still 
dominated to a large extent by the tech sector, which can 
be a little . . . lame . . . if you're not into it. Los Angeles, 
too, sucks in people who want to work in the entertainment industry, while Washington DC is a magnet for political/government types. These places are great in their 
own ways, but it can be hard to get away from it all when 
you want to. In new York, simply due to its sheer size, 
no one industry predominates. Finance is a huge business 
here, but it's remarkably easy to avoid ever dealing with 
Wall Street types if you don't want to. There are theater 
nerds, literary nerds, music nerds, and all else, but the 
occupational diversity in new York keeps anyone from operating too much inside a particular bubble. Perhaps most 
importantly, people choose to live in new York because 
they want to live in new York, not because they have to in 
order to get work in a particular industry. Half the people 
you meet in Washington DC, I'd argue, would move to 
new York in a heartbeat if their job allowed them to.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Fun on any budget</b>. Yes, rents in new York are really 
expensive. But (shhhh . . . ), here's a little secret. You can 
have a great time here without spending a lot of money. 
The subway, which runs 24/7, costs $2.25 a ticket and 
goes just about everywhere. There are millions of cheap 
places to eat, ranging from delis to ethnic dives to classic 
diners, and there are supermarkets everywhere for when 
you want to cook. If you're clever and creative, you can 
get massive discounts on typically pricey cultural items 
(theater tickets, concert tickets, etc.). Most importantly, 
just walking around outside is entertainment enough and 
doesn't cost you a thing. When I hear of people complaining about how they can't afford to have fun, I shake my 
head. The sky is the limit, obviously, when it comes to how 
much you can spend if you'd like. But when it comes down 
to it, anyone with a bit of creativity and savvy can have a 
great time in the city on a very limited budget.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Walk, walk, walk. </b>new York is the best walking city in 
the United States and one of the very best in the world. 
The "grid" system in Manhattan makes it idiot-proof (for 
people like me who lack a good sense of direction), and 
there are so many places to see that you'll never get bored. 
There are also pedestrian-friendly parks everywhere (Riverside, Central, Prospect) and a waterfront which can be 
very pleasant to stroll down when the weather cooperates. 
Can't afford a gym membership? Buy a good pair of walking shoes and explore the city. It's good for your mind and 
soul.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Convenience. </b>In new York, you can get any kind of food 
delivered to your door at any hour of the day. I exaggerate, 
but just slightly. Just about every major musical act, theater act, book reading, and other event will pass through 
town on its way around the country, or world. need to go 
to the company headquarters? It's probably in new York. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Beauty</b>. San Francisco is more beautiful, not to mention 
Paris and Rome and probably Istanbul and Barcelona, 
too. But new York has its fair share of beauty, beginning 
with gorgeous brownstone buildings, skyscrapers like the 
empire State Building, and the year-long magnificence 
of Central Park. on a more prurient level, there is also 
no shortage of beautiful people to gawk at, especially on 
a warm day.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Welcoming. </b>Someone once described new York to me as 
the world's most exclusive club that literally anyone can 
join. You don't have to have been born in new York to be 
a "new Yorker." If you know how to order a sandwich, negotiate the subway, not block the sidewalk, talk about real 
estate to strangers, laugh about Post headlines, complain 
about the weather, exercise basic taxi etiquette, tip properly, help a stranger with directions, and stop to cheer the 
Meetles in the Times Square subway stop, you're a new 
Yorker. It doesn't matter if you're originally from Lahore 
or Santo Domingo or Hamburg or Addis Ababa, or if 
you've been in the city for two years or your whole life. 
new York can be intimidating to the uninitiated, sure. 
But once you get settled, learn your way around, you'll see 
life here for what it really is: a gift.</p>

<h3>visiting new york city</h3>
<b><h2>What are good tips for hailing a 
taxi in Manhattan?</h2>
Max Cohen, BFA, MBA, CAB, Web Visionary</b><br/>
I drive a yellow cab. Here are some tips to the tourist, the new 
Yorker, and the tourist that thinks he's a new Yorker. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Don't wait till we are passing you to throw up your hail. 
We need to see you in advance so we can get over to you.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Get off that curb. It's okay, baby, this is nYC &mdash; don't be 
afraid. Stand in the street. Hang off the curb. Ignore those 
oncoming cars, they'll move . . . (maybe). Just remember, 
everyone's on the sidewalk: the masses, mailboxes, streetlights, homeless people, halal stands, cell phone case 
stands, overflowing trash bins, and red light cameras 
(Houston and Chrystie, I will get you!). If you want a cab, 
make yourself Seen!</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Go to a gas station between 4 and 5 a.m. or p.m. The shifts 
end at five, and cabbies need to fill up before they go in. 
There are only ten or twelve gas stations in Manhattan. 
eight of them are on the West Side on 10th Ave. Take 
your pick.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
 Lexington Avenue from 30th down to 23rd St. has the 
largest concentration of Indian restaurants in the city. I 
like curry in a hurry.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
Bond St. between Bowery and Lafayette is a major shift
change spot for private drivers that don't work for a garage. You will always find a ride when the shifts change 
from day to night.</p>

<h3>lincoln assassination</h3>
<b><h2>How likely would Abraham Lincoln 
be to survive his wounds today?</h2>
Laszlo B. Tamas, Many years spent covering Level 1 and 2 
trauma centers as a surgeon.</b>
<p>Without a CT scan and detailed neurological examination, 
it's hard to say definitively what internal brain injuries Lincoln sustained when he was shot. And when it comes to the 
brain, "God is indeed in the details."</p>
But there are a few lines of thinking that should be 
strongly considered:
<p><font size="-1">1.</font>
<b>By any measure, this injury was an absolute mess!</b> The 
bullet was big, shattered into smaller projectiles inside the 
brain, and also drove sharp pieces of skull into parts of the 
brain. It is wrong to think of just the "bullet trajectory" 
when assessing the damage it caused.</p>
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
<b> Bullets cause shock waves.</b> even at low velocity (for a 
bullet), a projectile passing through the brain will have a 
shock wave around its path which will injure brain areas 
well outside its strict trajectory. Just one example is how 
Lincoln's right eye was protruding out of the skull, even 
though the bullet did not injure it directly. Again, the "trajectory" is far from the only injury caused.</p>
<p><font size="-1">3.</font>
<b>There was blood in and around much of the brain.</b> Lincoln's autopsy report mentions injury to the lateral (transverse) venous sinus &mdash; one of the few brain structures that 
can cause exsanguinating hemorrhage. It also notes blood 
in both lateral ventricles, subarachnoid spaces all over the 
brain convexities, and widespread hemorrhage and contusion within the brain substance itself. This blood can 
lead to many potentially lethal things, including tentorial 
herniation, ischemia with vasospasm and stroke, and of 
course severe brain swelling. </p>
<p><font size="-1">4.</font>
<b>The brainstem was affected right from the start.</b> You don't 
have to see a CT scan or autopsy to know if the brainstem 
is injured (directly or indirectly), if it doesn't work right. </p>
<p>The description of the first doctor at the scene mentioned that Lincoln was not breathing, and one pupil was 
dilated (the latter a clear and unequivocal sign of dysfunction of the third cranial nerve or the upper brainstem, 
from where it comes). Unfortunately, the second doctor 
described the enlarged pupil being the right one (it's extremely unlikely to have been one and then the other &mdash; 
one of the doctors was probably mistaken as to the side). </p>
<p>By three hours after injury, both pupils were fixed and 
dilated, and Lincoln showed extensor (decerebrate) posturing &mdash; again, all signs of profound brainstem dysfunction (but not yet brain death, though pretty close to it).</p>
<p><font size="-1">5.</font>
<b> Most of Lincoln's brain injuries were "primary."</b> What 
therapies we have for brain injury have to do with fighting 
<b>secondary</b> processes: swelling and edema, ischemia, herniation and such. We have little to offer someone whose 
primary injury to deep brain structures is already severe 
right from the start. The brainstem signs Lincoln was 
witnessed to have within minutes (seconds?) of his injury 
prove that most of his coma was from <b>primary</b> injury. It 
is this <b>primary</b> injury that largely determines the grim 
prognosis.</p>
The following website has good info about what witnesses 
saw: http://www.galenpress.com/extras/extra29.htm
neither of the two people quoted in another answer &mdash;
<p>Thomas Scalea and Blaine Houmes &mdash; is a neurosurgeon (or 
neurologist), so I'm not sure they have a "feel" for the issues 
the way a neurosurgeon who sees brain injury all the time 
would (though Houmes has become an expert on this question). So it's not surprising that, for example, Scalea omits 
hemiplegia as an expected outcome if Lincoln had survived 
(of course he would have been hemiplegic!).</p>
<p>Also, Scalea seems to have a very optimistic view of what 
modern techniques can offer in cases of massive brain swelling, which Lincoln must definitely have had. Yes &mdash; we have 
more things we can throw at brain swelling these days, but 
that doesn't mean they are very successful.</p>
no, modern treatment would not have saved Lincoln. I 
rest my case.<br/>

<h3>rms titanic</h3>
<b><h2>How could the sinking of the 
Titanic have been prevented?</h2>
Chris O'Regan, amateur.</b>
<p><font size="-1">1.</font>
<i>Titanic</i> could have been constructed with a<b> double hull.</b>
The technology to construct double hulls was available: 
SS<i> Great Eastern</i> had been launched with a complete 
double hull over fifty years earlier, in 1858. In a classic 
failure of risk management, <i>Titanic</i>'s manufacturers, 
alongside with most shipbuilders at the time, considered 
a full double hull an unnecessary expense, being satisfied 
with a double bottom instead. This all changed after the 
disaster, with liners everywhere being refitted with full 
double hulls. Suddenly the expense didn't seem to matter 
so much.</p>
<p><font size="-1">2.</font>
 The quality of the <b>riveting and steel plates</b> could have 
been better. In the present day, ship plates are welded together using oxyacetelene torches. This technology was 
unvailable in <i>Titanic'</i>s time. Instead, <i>Titanic</i>'s overlapping steel hull plates were held together by rivets that 
were hammered in by hand. Most of the rivets were steel, 
but some were made of wrought iron; according to some, 
the rivets were poor-quality and contained large amounts 
of slag. The actual holing of the ship was caused when 
she dragged over the surface of the iceberg, with the berg 
snapping or popping the rivets along the hull, allowing 
water to enter in between the hull plates. The hull plates 
themselves are alleged to have not been strong enough, 
with signs of stress fracturing; but this is disputed.</p>
<p><font size="-1">3.</font>
The ship's <b>watertight bulkheads</b> could have been extended 
and fully sealed to reduce the risk of flooding. Titanic was 
constructed with transverse bulkheads (i.e. walls) to divide the ship into sixteen watertight compartments, which 
could be sealed off with doors operated either manually or 
remotely from the bridge. So far, so good. However, the 
bulkheads didn't extend up the height of all decks, and 
weren't sealed at the top. So while flooding could be safely 
be contained if only a small number of compartments 
were flooded, if too many flooded, water would reach over 
the top of the bulkheads and flood the rest of the compartments until the ship sank. The designer of the ship, 
Thomas Andrews, was on board and consulted by Captain 
Smith immediately after the iceberg was hit. He quickly 
realised that with five compartments flooded thanks to the 
iceberg dragging along the ship, the flooding could not be 
contained and the ship would eventually sink. His calculations convinced Smith to begin evacuations and therefore 
probably saved lives. Bulkhead design on subsequent ships 
would be improved as a result of the disaster.</p>
<p><font size="-1">4.</font>
Captain Smith could have <b>responded to the numerous ice 
warnings</b> the ship received by slowing down or stopping 
completely and waiting for daylight. <i>Titanic</i> was radioed 
several times by several different ships to warn of large 
amounts of ice in the area. <i>Titanic</i> acknowledged these 
warnings, but continued to cruise ahead at full speed. 
Captain Smith did respond to the warnings; he changed 
the ship's course to be more southerly, and he posted 
lookouts to watch specifically for icebergs. one of those 
lookouts did in fact spot the iceberg, but not with enough 
time to avoid a collision, since it was a moonless night 
and<i> Titanic</i> was travelling at around twenty knots, close 
to her maximum speed. This might seem insane to us now, 
but passenger liners had a very strict schedule to keep, 
and ships of her size and construction weren't considered 
to be vulnerable to icebergs (the 1997 movie implied <i>Titanic </i>was trying to break a speed record at the behest of J. 
Bruce Ismay, but that is fictional).</p>
<p><font size="-1">5.</font>
 The wireless (i.e. radio) operators could have <b>passed on 
the ice warnings with more urgency</b>. one incident in particular became notorious. The nearest ship to the Titanic 
before she sank was SS <i>Californian</i>; her captain had decided the ice was so bad that he would stop and try to 
resume the journey at first light. Californian's wireless 
operator signalled to Titanic about this. Unfortunately, 
that message came right at the time that Senior Wireless operator Jack Phillips was attempting to get through 
a backlog of passenger messages he hadn't been able to 
send off earlier (because the set had been broken earlier 
and <i>Titanic</i> hadn't been in range of the nearest wireless 
station, Cape Race, newfoundland). Californian's signal 
broke in over the top of Phillip's broadcast (these were 
wireless spark-gap transmitters that used morse code; signals couldn't be tuned out) and was very loud in his headphones because the ships were so close. Phillips angrily 
replied, "Shut up! Shut up! I'm working Cape Race!" Although this was not the only warning Titanic received, it 
happened less than ten minutes before the collision, so it 
might possibly have made a difference if Phillips had been 
paying more attention and had relayed it promptly to the 
bridge. A warning before that, from SS <i>Mesaba</i>, had not 
gone up to the bridge because Phillips was busy processing the passenger messages.</p>
<p><font size="-1">6.</font>
Finally, once the iceberg had been spotted, the officer on 
watch, First officer William Murdoch, <b>could have reacted differently </b>in trying to avoid a collision. Some have 
suggested that <i>Titanic</i> should have not attempted a course 
change and simply steamed over the top of the iceberg; I 
highly doubt this would have helped. But one thing that 
might have helped is if he hadn't ordered "Full Astern (i.e. 
reverse)" as he attempted to steer around the berg. Ships 
of the period did not have a throttle accessible on the 
bridge; instead, orders to change speed or direction were 
relayed to the engine room by a device known as an engine 
room telegraph (the famous circular brass contraption). 
once the message was received at the engine room, the 
engineers had to spend a few moments getting the ship's 
enormous engines to respond and switch to reverse (the 
steering gear, as well, took time to respond as the steampowered rudder moved into position). If the <i>Titanic</i> had 
not been slowing down as she approached the iceberg 
but instead continuing at full speed, she might have been 
more maneuverable, able to turn harder and avoid the iceberg entirely. But this is speculation: there was only a very 
short amount of time (around forty seconds) for Murdoch 
and the engine room to react, and something else could 
easily have gone wrong.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other things that could have been done 
to make the sinking less calamitous when it did happen (for 
example, the ship needed more lifeboats), but these are the 
main things that could have made a difference <i>prior to the 
collision itself</i>. once the hull had been breached across more 
than four compartments, which happened immediately after 
the iceberg struck, the ship was doomed.</p>

<h3>hipsters</h3>
<b><h2>What do hipsters know that I don't 
know?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p>Hipsters know that 
<b>culture makes progress</b>, and they celebrate that fact. This knowledge leads to actions that can make 
them appear pretentious, fickle, and lazy, when hipsters' approach to culture is actually more democratic, consistent, and 
diligent &mdash; and, therefore, <i>better</i> &mdash; than that of their "nonhipster" counterparts.</p>
The three most widely cited hipster flaws are, in fact, signs 
of vibrant cultural consumption:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Elitism</b>. As the previous answers make clear, hipster taste 
tends toward the obscure. Almost every question pertaining to hipsters includes a jab at their penchant for liking things that "you haven't heard of." But did you ever 
consider that this perspective might be a result of your 
shortcomings, not theirs? I can guarantee that hipsters 
are familiar with both popular and underground culture, 
yet they overwhelmingly prefer the latter. You, on the 
other hand, only know the former. Hipsters have given 
everything a chance, and have settled on niches they consider superior (usually rightly so). You are afraid to venture outside the cozy confines of mainstream media. Who 
is the elitist in this situation?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Capriciousness. </b>everyone values novelty in some aspects 
of their lives. nobody wants to watch the same movie every night, or use the same computer until the day they die. 
This is because novelty broadens our knowledge base and 
makes us more productive. So what's wrong with actively 
seeking novelty in music, art, film, and literature? Maybe 
it <i> is</i> inefficient to dwell on works that repeat last year's 
conventions, as progress in any area of society requires us 
to reject clich&eacute;s. Maybe hipsters' passion for the "new" is 
much healthier than your complacency.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Laziness.</b> Hipsters are often bashed for being consumers, 
rather than producers. But people forget that consumers 
are an integral part of any functioning economy. Hipsters 
limit their consumption of material goods, living five to 
a flat, shopping at thrift stores, and drinking cheap beer. 
But they provide a much-needed boost to the cultural 
sphere by eagerly buying records, going to concerts, and 
attending gallery openings. They represent what we could 
use more of in every area of society: critical, informed consumers who don't buy into something because "everyone 
else is doing it," but because they genuinely think it is better.</p>
<p>Therefore, hipsters know about a lot of things that you haven't 
heard of. But that should be considered a feature, not a flaw. 
And what's perceived as elitism is actually a public good. Hipsters tried to tell you, but you refused to listen.</p>
<p>If this seems like an outspoken defense of hipsters, that's 
because it is. <br/>
To be clear, I don't accept this label for myself, nor would 
most people identify me as a hipster. I don't wear hipster 
clothes, live in a hipster neighborhood, or work at a typical 
hipster job (or lack thereof). At the same time, I strongly 
identify with hipster culture. I listen to "indie" music, read 
Continental philosophy, and watch foreign films. In fact, my 
cultural knowledge puts most of my outwardly hipster friends 
to shame. But I don't seek out new media to impress others, 
as many would assume. I do it because I derive far more enjoyment and intellectual stimulation from "non-mainstream" 
culture. You could, too, if you knew what the hipsters know.</p>

<h3>american culture</h3>
<b><h2>Why does the USA insist on doing 
things differently than the majority 
of other developed nations?</h2>
Gary Teal, Republican</b>
<p>America doesn't insist on doing anything differently. We just 
do whatever the hell we want because we grew up in a world 
where we didn't know, and didn't need to know, what anyone 
else was doing.</p>
<p>From Columbus to the turn of the twentieth century, we 
weren't isolationist, we were isolated. of course, we imported 
our language from england and most of our culture from europe, but it's amazing how much we had to figure out on our 
own. When someone had the idea to build the erie Canal, 
there were no civil engineers living in America, so a couple 
of judges laid it out. obviously there are a million stories like 
that one, and just as obviously, it didn't mean that they did 
a better job than the dike builders in Holland. It's just that 
Americans waded into problems with little or no reference to 
how things were done outside the US. I don't want to exaggerate this effect; people continued to immigrate to the US and 
read books printed in england. But we were solving problems 
on our own even while others were doing the same work elsewhere. In some cases, like heavier than air flight or automobiles, everyone in America knows who was first in the world, 
and everyone in europe knows who was first in the world, but 
the names aren't the same.</p>
<p>We did in fact implement many technological innovations 
on a wide scale before other countries and have suffered a bit 
on the bleeding edge for our troubles. We have 110 volt power 
in the US, and we're stuck with it perhaps forever, but the rest 
of the world was able to wire for 220, which is more efficient. 
We laid a kabillion miles of copper cable for telephone communication and other countries will skip that for the most 
part.</p>
<p>By the time we finally engaged in world affairs in the 
twentieth century, we were already so large that we just didn't 
need much of anything in the way of manufactured goods or 
technology from outside the US. Shipping wasn't yet cheap, 
and services had to be done locally, so we traded with our 
small neighbor to the north and our underdeveloped neighbor to the south, but mostly didn't think very often about either of them any more than we did Siam.</p>
<p>After World War II, the US underwent a two decade 
boom time unprecedented in human history. our population 
and wealth grew to a point where we became even more selfsufficient than before, even as we were coming in contact with 
more of the world. In terms of many manufactured goods, 
we're different from the rest of the world not because everything we have is better, but because we form a large enough 
market to support any given product. I think TVs are even 
now measured in inches all over the world, right? I am not 
sure anybody makes TVs in the US any more, but we're a big 
market and our influence is still felt.</p>
<p>Being isolated and self-centered sounds awful, and in 
terms of a good intellectual education about the world, it is. 
But it was an outgrowth not of a bad attitude, or a superior 
attitude, but simple self-sufficiency. Americans often didn't 
speak a second language, especially in the second half of the 
twentieth century. French and German people spoke two or 
three in most cases. Was that because the Americans are jerks 
and the europeans are well-educated and urbane? of course 
not. It's because an American could live an entire lifetime in 
the US and never come across anybody who didn't speak his 
language. of course this extended to cultural issues as well; 
no need to understand how or when to bow or why to not eat 
with one's left hand, if you literally never encountered anyone 
who had different customs than you.</p>
<p>I believe this is all changing finally. Very nearly everyone 
you know can talk to any person anywhere on the planet now. 
(The cellphone statistic on Wikipedia is 80% of the world's 
seven billion people.) Many of us can see pictures or video 
taken by our friends, made just for us, on the other side of 
the planet either minutes ago or even streaming live. A larger 
and larger percentage of Americans know someone who is 
from another country or someone now living outside the US. 
our doughboys saw gay Paree, but now our soldiers are coming home with a thorough familiarity with nations that their 
fathers and mothers pretty much didn't know existed. </p>
<p>Will Americans seize the opportunity to learn about other 
cultures via all our new technology? Yes and no. As everyone 
in the world gets closer, we'll learn about the world but the 
world will also learn about us. To some extent, it is inevitable 
that virtually everyone on the grid will know at least one language among Chinese, Hindi, or english, and frankly, I'm 
betting on english as an almost universal language at some 
point in the lifetimes of my grandchildren. It's not because the 
US is imposing our language on anyone. We have an attractive culture (which is very different from, if not the opposite 
of, sophisticated culture). We have created a great deal of music and film that is available in english all over the world. If 
you want to consume those products, you'll end up learning 
some english. What language will Americans need to learn? 
Well, I'm glad we're offering our children a wider variety than 
old standbys Spanish and French (though I'm sorry we don't 
very often teach Latin, which gives you such a head start in 
five languages plus english itself), and we certainly are making strides, at least at better schools, with a broad range of offerings that emphasize Mandarin but include Arabic at many 
schools. (I don't hear much about Americans learning Hindi, 
though.) Still, an American can live without knowing another 
language, and that is the minimum test. An Italian or a Brazilian will find it much harder to be part of world trade and 
travel and culture if they don't learn a second language. C'est 
la vie. Many Americans won't learn a second language. Tant 
pis.</p>
<p>Please let me make it clear that no matter how jingoistic 
I might sound, there is no country which I would not want 
to live in for a month, and if I could be safe and dry, for a 
year. (I grew up in West Texas and just don't want to live for 
months on end in a rainy jungle with bugs everywhere. Sorry, 
Seattle.) I've mentioned it more than once, so you can guess 
already that I have a very special place in my heart for India, 
where I went on my honeymoon, and have been twice since. 
of all the places I've seen, India is where you can be farthest 
from America (I've never been to China). And of course you 
may know that it was not difficult for us to visit ten cities in 
India with ten different languages and &mdash; this is something 
that Americans don't appreciate the difficulty of &mdash; ten alphabets. (I know there are similarities but learning the first one is 
hard.) So I could spend thirty years in new Delhi and not understand everything I want to know, and then drive two hours 
west and start all over in Rajasthan. You run out of thirty year 
blocks of time pretty quickly; I'm quite likely on my last such 
block. I would literally burst into tears if I somehow learned 
that I would never see Paris again, or that I would never see 
Tokyo or Rio for the first time. </p>
<p>And yet, I do believe in an American exceptionalism that 
flows in great part from our system of government. I know 
there's an accepted and specific scholarly definition for that 
term, but I think it's fair to point out that exceptional does 
not mean "uniquely and permanently superior to all" in the 
vernacular. It means "really, really good." I believe the Communist Lovecraft was right, and that the US had some unique 
advantages that freed us from some of the historical problems 
that Communism was a response to. I don't believe that it 
should be taken to mean that the US has any supernaturally 
guided mission to lead the world as a political force. But the 
ideas that made American exceptional are ideas that other 
countries will find advantageous if and when they do adopt 
them. We set a good example. There is a future just ahead 
in which fifty nations are just as rich and safe and comfortable and well educated as we are today, and some day a world 
where virtually everyone is as rich and safe and comfortable 
and well educated as we are today. I think it's stunning that 
such a young nation as ours is operating under the world's 
oldest constitution. This is not to say that our constitution 
would work this well in any other nation, but it has worked 
extremely well for us. Capitalism has worked for us. The Rule 
of Law has worked for us. And a culture of transparency has 
worked for us. We should be proud of our multiculturalism, 
and it may be this, if anything, that teaches us the value of 
learning more about the various cultures of our family's (often 
multiple) origins and those of our neighbors. In each of these 
areas, we started with more of an ideal than a reality, and in 
each case we make progress decade by decade. none of these 
things is uniquely American at all. It's a political disaster if 
or when they get labeled as American ideas, because each developing country should want their own version of these concepts, not the American concept of them. While I think we 
are doing very well compared to most countries, my own definition of American exceptionalism includes actively working 
to help any country who wants the help reach the same level. 
our exceptionalism is not measured in a way that implies that 
we will always be better than the rest of the world. It means 
that we're closer to our own ideals.</p>

<h3>recruiting</h3>
<b><h2>What do recruiters look for in a 
resume at first glance?</h2>
Ambra Nykol, Recruiter @ LivingSocial, Google, Expedia, 
&amp; for Microsoft</b>
<p>I think this varies from recruiter to recruiter and also depends on the role for which you're applying. For one, I don't 
look through stacks of resumes anymore. I hate paper. I do 
everything online. But I'll highlight briefly how <i>I </i>personally
absorb a resume. I should preface this by saying that I primarily recruit for senior-level individuals. In my past life, I was a 
campus recruiter, and you read resumes of new grads a bit 
differently since experience is less of a factor. I'll address how 
I read a mid- to senior-level resume:</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Most recent role</b> - I'm generally trying to figure out what 
this person's current status is and why they might even be 
interested in a new role. Are they laid off? Did they get 
fired? Have they only been in their role for a few months? 
Is their most recent experience relevant to the position for 
which I'm hiring?</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Company recognition </b>- not even gonna lie. I am a company snob. It's not even that I think certain companies 
are better than others (although some are). It's purely a 
matter of how quickly can I assign a frame of reference. 
This is often more difficult to do when a candidate has only 
worked for obscure companies I've never heard of. When 
I can't assign company recognition, it just means I have 
to read the resume a little deeper, which usually isn't an 
issue, unless it's poorly formatted and wrought with spelling errors in which case . . . you lost my interest.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Overall experience</b> - Is there a career progression? Do 
they have increasing levels of responsibility? Do the titles 
make sense? Do the responsibilities listed therein match 
what I'm looking for.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Keyword search</b> - Do they have the specific experience for 
the role I'm hiring for? I Command + F the crap out of 
resumes. on any given day, I'm searching for things like 
Ruby on Rails, Mule, Business Intelligence, MBA, Consulting, PoS, Cisco, Javascript, and seriously, anything 
you can think of.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Gaps</b> - I don't mind gaps so long as there's a sufficient 
explanation. oh, you took three years off to raise your 
children? Fine by me, and might I add, I bow down. You 
tried your hand at starting your own company and failed 
miserably? Very impressive! Gap sufficiently explained. 
Whatever it is, just say it. It's the absence of an explanation that makes me wonder.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Personal web presence</b> - This includes personal domains, 
Twitter handle, GitHub contributions, dribbble account, 
or anything a candidate has chosen to list. Two out of 
three times, I almost always click through to a candidate's 
website or twitter account. It's one of my favorite parts of 
recruiting. Random aside: I care less about what people

I will be speaking to that person on the phone. But I will not

things i rarely pay attention to
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Education - </b>In the last month alone having viewed hundreds of resumes, I honestly don't remember looking 
at this section once. When I used to exclusively recruit 
MBAs, this was one of the first things I looked for because 
I was generally looking for top tier b-schools. When I used 
to be a campus tech recruiter, I immediately checked for 
top CS schools. But outside of my old campus recruiting 
days, I am not often looking at the education. I think this 
is because at the level I generally hire, it's the least of what 
I'm looking for. experience is king. I can think of a few 
exceptions where perhaps a hiring manager wanted a certain pedigree, but that's happening less and less, I find. I 
will also add that this changes <i>drastically</i> by industry and 
company. I currently work in tech, but I've also worked 
in management consulting and education is huge in consulting. I'll also add that some tech companies care more 
about education than others &mdash; take Google or Facebook 
for example (I'm using big companies just for name recognition).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Fancy Formatting</b> - There are exceptions here. I say this 
with the caveat that I LoVe a creatively formatted resume. LoVe. In fact, on Pinterest, I've started collecting 
beautifully presented resumes. However, it's important to 
keep in mind that if you're applying to a position online, 
whether it's a PDF or not, most companies' applicant 
tracking systems parse your resume for information and 
convert it to pure text as the most immediate viewing format. Recruiters don't often see how awesome your resume 
is. The original file is usually there for us, but most recruiters aren't clicking through to that. If you're going to 
do something fun with your resume, I recommend having 
a clean text resume as well whenever possible so it doesn't 
come through our system looking wonky. Also, if the formatting is important, always send in PDF. nine times out 
of ten, if I genuinely like a candidate and all I have is a 
text resume, I'll ask them to send me the prettier version 
for when I present them to a hiring manager.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Uncomfortably personal details</b> - There are legal reasons 
here. I learn to tune out certain things like marital status, family status (whether or not a person has children), 
reference to health or medical issues/triumphs, personal 
photos). Including things like this is common in CVs in 
other countries, but it seriously makes me uncomfortable 
when people include photos with their resumes. If I want 
to see what you look like, I'll stalk you on LinkedIn . . . and 
maybe other places. Can't confirm that.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Cover letters</b> - I abhor them and rarely read them. Most 
of my recruiting colleagues agree, but I know there are 
still recruiters that do. I find that a lot of candidates don't 
even send them anymore (Hallelujah). If you're going to 
send one, that puppy better be darn good. I'm of the mind 
that most companies that request cover letters only do so 
to weed out the people who haven't bothered to read the 
directions.</p>
<b>Things i wish more people would do</b>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Bring personality into the resume</b> - We recruiters are 
staring at these missives all day long. Throw a joke in 
there somewhere for goodness sake. Talk about how much 
you love nutella (I have this in my own personal resume). 
If you're a rockstar, throw some cheeky self-deprecation in 
there if you can do so elegantly. I think it's important to 
keep the work experience details as professional as possible, but trust me, there are ways to have fun with it. I love 
an easter egg buried in a resume . . . figuratively speaking.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Include URLs for other web presences</b> - nuff said. And 
within your comfortability of course. I get it. I don't want 
professional acquaintances to see my Facebook page either.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> List key personal projects</b> - I ask this in almost every 
phone interview I do. "What kind of stuff are you working 
on in your free time?" I am always inspired by this. Also 
shows me that you have passion for your field beyond your 
9-5 (ha, ha, like those even exist anymore).</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Use color and lovely typography</b>
<p>things i wish people would stop doing<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Using MS Word's resume templates</b> - Period.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Writing resumes in first person</b> - exceptions made for 
people who do it cleverly.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Allowing their resume to be a ridiculous number of pages</b> - Unless you are a college professor with multiple published works, you do not need an 8+ page resume. That 
is not impressive; that is obnoxious. Condense that bad 
boy, s'il vous plait. Also, I do not care that you worked at 
Burger King in 1988. I mean, good for you, but no; not 
relevant.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Mixing up first person and third person or present tense 
and past tense </b>- Pick a voice, pick a tense, and then stick 
with it. I suggest third person and past tense.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Listing an objective at the top of the resume </b>- Dude, seriously? This isn't 1992.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Mailing, faxing, or hand-delivering paper resumes</b> - immediate disqualification. Do not pass go.
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Sending resumes addressed to the CEO that end up on 
my desk unopened</b> - This is a gross generalization here 
and exceptions are made for smaller companies, but um,

this.</p>

<h3>product management</h3>
<b><h2>What distinguishes the top 1% of 
product managers from the top 
10%?</h2>
Ian McAllister, I lead unusual projects at Amazon</b>
The top 10% of product managers excel at a few of these 
things. The top 1% excel at most or all of them:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Think big</b> - A 1% PM's thinking won't be constrained by 
the resources available to them today or today's market 
environment. They'll describe large disruptive opportunities and develop concrete plans for how to take advantage 
of them.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Communicate</b> - A 1% PM can make a case that is impossible to refute or ignore. They'll use data appropriately, 
when available, but they'll also tap into other biases, beliefs, and triggers that can convince the powers that be to 
part with headcount, money, or other resources and then 
get out of the way.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Simplify</b> - A 1% PM knows how to get 80% of the value out 
of any feature or project with 20% of the effort. They do so 
repeatedly, launching more and achieving compounding 
effects for the product or business. </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Prioritize</b> - A 1% PM knows how to sequence projects. 
They balance quick wins vs. platform investments appropriately. They balance offense and defense projects appropriately. offense projects are ones that grow the business. 
Defense projects are ones that protect and remove drag on 
the business (operations, reducing technical debt, fixing 
bugs, etc.). </p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Forecast and measure</b> - A 1% PM is able to forecast the 
approximate benefit of a project and can do so efficiently 
by applying past experience and leveraging comparable 
benchmarks. They also measure benefit once projects are 
launched and factor those learnings into their future prioritization and forecasts.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Execute</b> - A 1% PM grinds it out. They do whatever is 
necessary to ship. They recognize no specific bounds to 
the scope of their role. As necessary, they recruit, they 
produce buttons, they do bizdev, they escalate, they tussle 
with  internal  counsel . . .</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Understand technical trade-offs</b> - A 1% PM does not need 
to have a CS degree. They do need to be able to roughly 
understand the technical complexity of the features they 
put on the backlog, without any costing input from devs. 
They should partner with devs to make the right technical 
trade-offs (i.e. compromise).</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Understand good design</b> - A 1% PM doesn't have to be a 
designer, but they should appreciate great design and be 
able to distinguish it from good design. They should also 
be able to articulate the difference to their design counterparts, or at least articulate directions to pursue to go 
from good to great.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Write effective copy</b> - A 1% PM should be able to write 
concise copy that gets the job done. They should understand that each additional word they write dilutes the 
value of the previous ones. They should spend time and 
energy trying to find the perfect words for key copy (button labels, nav, calls-to-action, etc.), not just words that 
will suffice.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I've ever met a 1% PM, certainly not one that 
I identified as such prior to hiring. Instead of trying to hire 
one, you're better off trying to hire a 10% PM who strives to 
develop and improve along these dimensions.</p>

<h3>productivity</h3>
<b><h2>How can you increase your 
productivity on your side projects at 
the end of the day when you&rsquo;re tired 
from work/college?</h2>
Kah Keng Tay, Quora Engineer</b>
<p>I try to 
<b>minimize startup and switching costs</b>, in other words, 
the time it takes to get started working on the side project. 
This way, even if I only have a few minutes to work on it before I turn in for the night, I can still do something useful. 
Also, I try to <b>make each opportunity count</b>. These are hard 
to come by, and so it is good not to waste any single minute.</p>
This boils down to me doing some or all of the following:
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Keeping as much state persistent across sessions as possible.</b> I leave all my editors, browser windows, etc exactly 
the way they are so I can pick up and resume where I left
off. This means I usually never shut down my computer, 
preferring to put it to sleep or standby where possible.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Having a quick and painless to-do list.</b> I used to do this in 
a text file but I've recently started to use evernote for this. 
Then, when secondary tasks crop up that are not central 
to what I'm doing right now, I'll put them on the list and 
work on them later.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Biting off only what can be chewed.</b> Related to above, I 
make sure I tackle only what seems reasonably possible 
within the time I have. If I took on too big a task and 
didn't manage to finish, and only got back to it a few days 
later, I would have forgotten by then some of the reasons 
why I did things in a certain way. This would cost me time 
that is spent rethinking and refactoring my design unnecessarily.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Prioritizing tasks according to what is important (or 
interesting if I'm not feeling particularly inspired).</b> This 
goes in line with making each opportunity count. In downtime, I would transfer some of the tasks in the lightweight 
list into something more persistent for issue tracking and 
prioritizing. I found Trac with a Git or Mercurial plugin 
to be pretty useful for this purpose, and it helps me to 
keep focused with the big picture in mind.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Having near-term milestones.</b> These are helpful to stay 
motivated and give you some pressure to keep on-track 
with your goals. I think it's easiest to just have a single 
feature in mind and a fixed date that you want it finished, 
and use that to inform your decision making.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Deserializing in advance mentally.</b> The concept of serialization in computer science refers to storing state in a 
form that can be persisted. In the case of a side project, 
between the times you get to work on it, your ideas and 
thoughts often live in your biologically memory, probably 
in medium- to long-term storage. I've found that it takes 
time to get all that back into the forefront of your thinking and creative process, but it's a waste if that time could 
be spent actually working on your project. Instead, I'll 
spend my commute doing that deserialization, mentally 
getting ready a list of things I'd be able to do right away 
once I get home.</p>
Some of the above are also pretty applicable to regular work, 
so it's good for general productivity if they become habits.

<h3>management</h3>
<b><h2>How do you fire an employee that 
just isn't good enough?</h2>
Michael O. Church, NYC machine learning functional programmer, writer, and game designer.</b>
<p>The best employees are multipliers who make others more 
productive, and next are the adders (workhorses). Subtractors are the good-faith incompetents who cost more than they 
bring. Dividers are the worst kind of problem employee; they 
bring the whole team (or company) down. </p>
<p>Right now, it sounds like he's a 
<i>subtracter</i>. He's not a bad 
person, and he's not doing substantial harm, but he's worth 
less than he costs (including communication overhead). </p>
<p><b>Dividers:</b>
 fire them immediately. Don't wait a day. Prefer 
severance over a "performance improvement plan" (PIP). 
Severance is cheaper than having a fired employee come into 
work for two months while you build a case. People tend to 
be averse to writing packages for bad employees, as if they're 
"rewarding failure," but this is business and it's not the place 
for that kind of emotion. Pay the go-away fee, but fire dividers 
as soon as you can. A divider can easily cost you ten thousand 
dollars per day in damaged morale and internal friction. </p>
<p><b>Subtractors: </b>
good-faith employees who just aren't producing more than they cost. You're losing money on them, but 
in small amounts. <b>If you can turn them into adders, try to 
do so. </b>Most people start out new jobs as subtractors, and the 
problem may be project/person fit rather than the employee. 
Find mentors, move them around, and give them chances as 
long as (a) you can afford to do so and (b) they remain basically decent (i.e. they're trying to do good work). This "not 
very bright" guy might surprise you if you change the context. 
I've seen that happen. </p>
<p><b>When you turn a subtractor into an adder, what you get 
is a very loyal employee; someone who was well-mentored 
and learned a lot. </b>Three years later, you might have a <i>bona 
fide</i> multiplier. I've seen it happen. </p>
<p><b>You really need to ask yourself, "Is he hurting anyone?"</b>
If the only loss is that you're paying $100k per year for $80klevel work, then he's probably not an existential threat to your 
company. You should "manage him out" (i.e. find a way to convince him to leave with his dignity intact) eventually if you see 
no hope of improving, but don't be rash about it and don't be 
a dick. People talk.</p>
<p><b>Whatever you do, don't use a formal "performance improvement plan" (PIP).</b> everyone knows what it means when 
a manager starts "documenting." This process turns a subtractor into a divider instantly. If you see no alternative to letting 
the person go, then you should prefer severance over the PIP. 
HR departments like PIPs because they "save money" on severance payments, but the reality is that they externalize the 
cost to the team, making HR look good but forcing (a) managers to conduct a kangaroo court, (b) the team to deal with 
a walking-dead employee, and (c) the employee to decipher 
whether it's an honest PIP (rare) or firing papers; because in 
the latter, he should be treating the PIP period as severance 
(since a PIP usually means there will be no severance; that's 
why the CYA papers exist) and putting his entire effort into 
his job search. </p>
<p><b>Writing a package.</b>
 Have an attorney draft it. Include 
non-disparagement, non-litigation, and non-disclosure of the 
contract's existence. offer to let him represent himself as employed during the search for the next job. If this is a goodfaith subtractor, offer a positive reference. If he's a divider and 
you truly believe he's toxic, stick to name and dates. By the 
way, it's <b>never</b> worth it to give a bad reference. Defamation 
lawsuits are usually less of an issue than wrongful termination suits, but the latter come down to "he-said/she-said," and 
the company usually gets the benefit of the doubt, but loses 
it the second a bad reference comes into play. Giving a bad 
reference can literally cost you millions of dollars.</p>

<h3>career advice</h3>
<b><h2>How do you know when it&rsquo;s time 
to leave your current company and 
move on?</h2>
Edmond Lau, Quora Engineer</b><br/>
A number of red flags should cause you to reconsider your 
position at your current company, including: 
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
being compensated unfairly.<br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
being mistreated, undervalued, or disrespected.</p>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
disagreeing with the fundamental strategy or practices of 
the company and not being in a position to change them. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font> failing to get along with your manager and your teammates. <br/>
<font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
failing to fit in with the company culture.<br/>
These types of reasons aren't too hard to identify and provide 
concrete justifications for trying something new. 
<p><b>It's also time to leave when your learning rate at your job 
tapers off and starts to plateau. </b>This is a much more subtle 
reason for leaving that's harder for people to recognize but 
likely affects a much larger group of people. Transitioning to 
another team or company provides an opportunity to switch 
to a different learning curve and to accelerate your learning. </p>
<p>Paying attention to your learning rate is important in 
general but particularly important for young professionals. 
Learning is an investment in yourself for the future. It also 
compounds &mdash; knowledge not only begets knowledge, but 
more knowledge gives you a foundation upon which to gain 
knowledge even faster. This is why most people learn more in 
college than they did in high school and more in high school 
than they did in earlier years. Ideally, out of college, you 
should set yourself up to learn even more than before. </p>
<p>Palantir co-founder Stephen Cohen captures the importance of the compounding effects of learning, in an argument 
for why college graduates ought to work at startups instead of 
established companies [1]: </p>
<p><font size="-1">If you graduate Stanford at 22 and Google recruits you, you&rsquo;ll 
work a 9-to-5. It&rsquo;s probably more like an 11-to-3 in terms of hard 
work. They&rsquo;ll pay well. It&rsquo;s relaxing. But what they are actually 
doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth 
rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, 
the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. 
They&rsquo;re not giving you the best opportunity of your life. Then a 
scary thing can happen: You might realize one day that you&rsquo;ve 
lost your competitive edge. You won&rsquo;t be the best anymore. You 
won&rsquo;t be able to fall in love with new stuff. Things are cushy 
where you are. You get complacent and stall.</font></p>
Startups might not be for everyone, but the message about 
not shortchanging your intellectual growth rate still applies. 
<p>What about a passion for what you're working on? A 
strong passion and excitement in your company mission or 
in what you're doing is critical to sustaining a steep learning 
curve. Passion and meaningful work supply the motivation for 
long-term learning [2] and allow you to stay in a state of flow 
more often. Mihayli Csikszentmihalyi, one of the world's leading researchers in positive psychology, developed the theory 
of "flow," a state where you enjoy what you're doing so much 
that you don't even notice the passage of time, and found that 
more flow generally leads to more happiness [3]. It's hard to 
stay motivated to learn or to enter a state of flow in the long 
run unless you believe in and enjoy what you do, and it's also 
hard not to be getting better if you love what you're doing. </p>
Assessing your learning rate first requires identifying the 
many different types of learning can happen on a job: 
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b> Technical learning specific to your job function.</b> For a 
software engineering position, for example, this might include things like learning a new language, getting familiar with new tools, improving your ability to design new 
systems, etc. Getting better at these skills makes you more 
proficient as an individual contributor.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Prioritization skills.</b> oftentimes, there are tens or hundreds of things that you could be working on that might 
generate value. Figuring out the highest leverage activity 
that generates the most value for the least amount of work 
at any given point is hard, but it's probably the single most 
valuable lesson you can learn professionally [4].</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Execution.</b> Learning how to or how not to build and deliver a great product or service and how to do it consistently and on time takes practice.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Mentorship / management skills.</b> The faster an organization grows, the sooner you become a more senior member 
of the team. Seniority provides opportunities to mentor or 
manage other teammates, to shape the company culture 
and values that develop, and to influence the direction of 
the team.</p>
<p><font size="-1">&bull;	</font>
<b>Team leadership skills. </b>The skills needed to make a team 
function effectively differ from those needed to be productively as an individual. How should milestones be organized? How do you coordinate effectively and minimize 
communication overhead? How do you make sure a team 
gels?</p>
<p>At various points in your career, you'll value these skills differently and should seek out opportunities that develop the skills 
you value. All of these skills are mostly generalizable beyond 
your job at your current company. You take those skills and 
experiences with you to your next job. </p>
<p>There's also a type of learning that's important for career 
success but that is less transferable to other companies. And 
that's institutional learning on how to function well within 
the specific processes defined at the company: how to get the 
approval of key gatekeepers for decisions, how to get projects you believe in prioritized on the roadmap, how to negotiate for more resources for your team given the company's 
resource allocation process, etc. Some amount of this is necessary to do well, and some of the negotation and persuasion 
skills will help in the future, but to the extent that much of 
this learning deals with the particular bureacracy or process 
that you need to deal with, it's significantly less valuable than 
other types of learning.</p>
<p>When you first join a company, the learning curve usually 
starts really steep (hopefully, if you've made a good choice). 
You're immersed in new technologies, in a new product, and 
on a new team, and there are opportunities to learn along 
multiple dimensions. When I first joined Google right out of 
college, I learned a lot in my first six months there. Google's 
done a great job with their GoogleeDU training materials. 
I soaked in all the codelabs that discussed why core abstractions existed and how they worked. I studied programming 
style guides to learn best industry practices. I read design docs 
about search indexing and other scalable engineering systems 
being built internally. I learned to build and ship something 
seen by tens to hundreds of millions of people per day on 
google.com. </p>
<p>Your learning rate might decrease due to organizational 
issues (maybe processes have become too bureaucratic and 
limit your ability to iterate and launch quickly) or due to maintenance issues where the team doesn't grow quickly enough to 
scale with the complexity of the product. The second makes it 
hard for you to switch projects and work on new things. </p>
<p>Warning flags for me at Google started to appear when 
I realized that many projects either had no concrete launch 
paths or depended on non-transparent approval processes 
over which I had little visibility or control. Being able to 
launch products was important to the extent that I wanted to 
learn how to build great products, and quick, iterative feedback is a necessary foundation for learning. When I projected 
what I could accomplish and reasonably launch by staying an 
additional year, I didn't feel satisfied, so I left. There was certainly more I could have learned by staying &mdash; I could have 
dug into the internals of more major systems &mdash; but my rate 
of learning no longer mirrored what I encountered when I 
first started.</p>
<p>I similarly left ooyala when I felt that my own learning 
rate at the company began to plateau. While I was there, I 
learned about building and selling an enterprise product, the 
intricacies of flash video and analytics, project estimation and 
team organization, and more. I left when it became clear to 
me that I could learn much more on engineering and on building a product by joining a smaller and faster-growing team. 
A contributing factor that I only discovered after working at 
ooyala for a while was that I wasn't nearly as excited and motivated to work on an enterprise product as I was to work on 
a consumer product that I would actually use everyday.</p>
<p>Having worked at Quora for two years, I'm happy that I'm 
still continuously learning new things at a good rate [5, 6], 
and it certainly helps that the product itself is also so learning-focused.</p>
<p>When I interned at Microsoft the summer of my junior 
year in college, I received a good piece of advice secondhand 
from a friend's mentor: always re-examine and reflect on 
where you are in your career at least every two years. even if 
you're perfectly happy with your job, the exercise forces you to 
check that you are actually enjoying your work and learning 
on the job rather than just being comfortable.</p>

<h3>trains</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be in a train 
crash?</h2>
Faisal Abid, Software Engineer, Entrepreneur and Author</b>
<p>Being in a train crash is a very interesting experience. It&rsquo;s the 
scariest thing that I've been through, and the most enlightening. </p>
<b>Let me start off by describing how it was scary. </b>
<p>Sam Beck and I were coming back to Toronto from niagara Falls when, about twenty minutes or so into the journey, 
the train bounced and started to tilt sideways. </p>
<p>This is one of those feelings I won't ever forget. 
The train probably took less than ten seconds to tip over, 
but for me, those ten seconds felt like ten hours. Since I was 
sitting on the right side, the same side the train was tipping 
over to, people, luggage, and, even worse, laptops came flying 
into me. <br/>
While I have no idea how far the train skidded on its side, 
it also felt like it wasn't going to end. It kept violently shaking till it finally came to a stop. once it stopped, that's when 
things went from worse to ugly.<br/>
once the train stopped, things went quiet for a second. 
Then the panic started, people started to cry for help, I turned 
around after managing to stand up and saw that some people 
really got banged up badly. I'm not going to elaborate on the 
injuries out of respect for their privacy, but there was quite a 
lot of blood and people panicking thinking they were going 
to die.<br/>
What made matters worse was when the entire train car 
started to fill with smoke/gas. This was <b>THE scariest moment of my life. </b>Why? It's one thing to die suddenly in a train 
crash, it's another thing to think that your cabin is being filled 
with something that is going to explode, and you're just waiting for death.<br/>
Why couldn't we have just gone out the emergency windows or exits? <br/>
All the emergency windows on the right side were blocked 
by the ground, and there was no way to go through the exits 
on the left side &mdash; which was now our roof &mdash; because the 
chairs were crazy unstable with metal sticking out of them. 
Plus, none of us could actually reach that high or climb ourselves up. <br/>
Soon we heard from one of the people in charge that the 
ambulance and firefighters are on their way.<br/>
But that wait felt like forever. What happened during 
those moments is very interesting. First, everyone who wasn't 
injured started to help out the people in need. either by telling them everything is going to be okay, or getting them to 
a safer area. Second, there seemed to be a small community 
that formed. We got to know each other, not personally, but 
there was this connection that formed, and we knew that 
whatever happened, we were not going to let anything happen to anyone on that train.<br/>
once the firefighters came, they broke in through the top 
corner of the train and came in. I've never actually seen firefighters up close, so it was kinda cool. These guys looked like 
'Gears of War' characters, huge with crazy equipment and 
awesome professionalism. They came in and got right to business. They went to the injured people, they made sure they 
were safe, and got the people who were able to help them out.<br/>
one of the hardest things to do was leave the train from 
the other side. Since there were quite a few injured people 
who could not have been taken out right away, we had to unfortunately go over them and the paramedics that were also in 
the train helping them. Going over them was hard, it felt like 
a disaster movie, where every step you took, you had to make 
sure the seat wasn't just going to give in and send you falling 
and breaking a leg or something.<br/>
We eventually got out of there and were rushed by paramedics who gave us full medical evaluation. We waited in a 
bus till the authorities told us it was okay to go home, and 
we basically took a subway home. nothing dramatic, nothing 
crazy compared to what we just went through.</p>
<b>How it was enlightening:</b>
<p>During the months before the crash, I was going through 
a very hard phase because of my first startup. We were battling every day with the possibility of us failing, and I took it 
harder than anyone else. After all, I had dropped out of school 
to follow my passion, and it looked like I was going to be a 
loser for the rest of my life because of my failed startup.</p>
<p>Then the train crash happened, and something changed 
in me. To paraphrase, I saw that life is short; I could be dead 
tomorrow. I realized that rather than worrying about failure 
and what people will think of me, I should just focus on what 
I do, do it to the best of my ability, and keep persisting. If I 
fail (which my startup did), then great &mdash; I am still breathing, 
and that means I could start my next one (which I've done). </p>
<p>I won't say I've become someone amazing who is super 
productive all the time, but I have become more mature and 
more responsible. I know what to do, I know what to focus 
on. I know not to worry about what people will think of me, 
because at the end of the day when I die, it won&rsquo;t make a difference what they thought, the only thing that will matter is 
what I've accomplished.</p>

<h3>scientology</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to leave the Church 
of Scientology?</h2>
Flemming Funch, Ex-Scientologist, declared Suppressive 
Person (excommunicated) in 1982. OT16.</b><br/>
It is usually very hard and takes a long time.
<p>I was kicked out, excommunicated, and declared a "suppressive person" in 1982. Yet, at the time, I didn't agree, and I 
tried hard to be taken back. It wasn't before about a year later 
that I realized that I was much better outside that organization, and I wouldn't want to ever be a member of it again.</p>
<p>At that time, I was essentially still a Scientologist, just one 
that had disagreements with the way the organization was 
run. It took me another number of years to get over that and 
consider myself an ex-scientologist.</p>
<p>Leaving the organization and leaving the subject are two 
different things, but typically tightly interwoven. one is afraid 
of leaving the oppressive cultish organization because one is 
afraid of letting go of that whole manner of thinking and that 
body of material which is Scientology.</p>
<p>I could talk for hours about my experiences, so it is hard 
to put into a brief message. Leaving the Church of Scientology is probably similar in many ways to leaving any other allencompassing religious type of organization. You know, one 
where most of your friends and family members are members, 
and so are your business partners, your employers, etc. Where 
it guides what books you read, how you interpret the news, 
how you plan things, which things you plan on doing, etc. It is 
so all-pervasive that it is very hard to leave. If you do, you have 
to come up with new ways of doing almost everything. And if 
the tradition in that organization or religion is to shun people 
who leave, all the worse, you have to find new friends, maybe 
even a new family. The escape velocity is very high. You really 
need to gather yourself together to leave. or you have to be 
thrown out quite forcefully before you really leave.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it is very freeing to leave an organization 
that tries to control your thinking. It can be a very healthy 
process to sort out for yourself what you actually think is true 
and how you want to think and feel. The more the subject 
you're leaving has pretended to have the answer to everything, 
the longer it takes to sort through. But it is worth it.</p>

<h3>kidnapping and ransom</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be kidnapped?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p>I was kidnapped eight years ago, and it changed me forever. 
It's an experience you wouldn't want to wish on your worst 
enemy. Thankfully, I wasn't harmed physically, so I can't imagine what the experience is like for others.</p>
<p>I was out with my mom running some errands, and we returned home at night around nine in the evening. In our part 
of the world, it's common to have a guard (ours was unarmed) 
because robberies are common, kidnappings aren't. The gate 
was opened by a stranger wearing a guard's uniform &mdash; later 
we found out it was one of the kidnappers who had beaten 
up the guard and was wearing his uniform. There were three 
others, and we found them in the house pointing a gun at my 
dad's head &mdash; his hands were tied, and I can never forget the 
look on his face and his body language (total helplessness).</p>
<p>The four home invaders/robbers (at that point we didn&rsquo;t 
know this was a kidnapping) stayed at our place for the next 
eight hours, ransacking the place and grabbing anything that 
caught their attention (for example they took gold cufflinks). 
They were heavily armed and had an AK47 and a couple of 
pistols. They also had some kind of drug in a vial and a syringe which they said they were going to use on me if I didn't 
cooperate (that's what they used on our guard after beating 
him up).</p>
<p>At the end, closer to day break, they let us know that they 
didn't find enough in the house and were going to take me 
with them for ransom. They let me change, and I said one of 
the most painful goodbyes to my parents &mdash; basically we were 
prepared to not see each other in this world ever again.</p>
<p>The kidnappers got in one of the cars (the one without 
GPS tracking) and drove about three to four hours. They 
made me promise to close my eyes otherwise they would drug 
me. We got to a "safe house" in a rural area at the end of 
the journey where they had more weapons and food etc. Here 
they separated into two groups with two of them taking me on 
a motorbike while the rest took our car.</p>
<p>This was the start of a very dangerous part of the journey . . . I was sandwiched between the two guys, the guy behind me had the AK47 between us . . . definitely a very blunt/
hard implied threat. Shortly after we took off from the safe 
house, they got very tense, saying that a group of rivals was on 
the way to kill them. We basically sped through roads, markets, and other areas, which added to the stress. At different 
points, we had to take refuge in fruit orchards and fields to 
"evade" this group coming after them.</p>
<p>By evening, we got to another safe house in a rural area. 
I could see villagers and other people around, and it became 
evident that they knew what was going on and that they 
wouldn't help. They were either afraid of these guys or were 
in on the take. </p>
<p>The other two who took our car came back by evening, 
also a bit shaken up. They had encountered the police, and 
our car had been banged up a bit because it had fallen into a 
canal. I'm a Muslim and have strong faith, so I had been praying and reciting the Quran, which seemed to unsettle them 
a bit. I had also talked to my parents once, and they let me 
know that they'd asked someone to pray at the Holy Mosque 
in Mecca and Medina. I also let them know about this. All of 
this info (the people following us on the bike, the car accident, and the praying) definitely got to them, and I think they 
made a decision to get a ransom as soon as possible and let me 
go. They were a superstitious bunch and at some level, they 
were trying to justify what they were doing in a rational way. </p>
<p>They also admitted they knew the local police and had 
been arrested before. They had paid them off and escaped 
more than once, and the AK47 was a police issue. They also 
were a professional bunch and had killed and kidnapped 
many people before in other cities.</p>
<p>I got to spend the night with them, but the next morning 
they had arranged to meet my dad for the ransom. They drove 
with me to the pick up point and let me go. </p>
<p>In the end, I am thankful to God that I got away &mdash; I think 
my faith and our concept of Karma/Fate helped me through 
this ordeal. But it has left a scar &mdash; life will never be the same 
again. It was hard to trust anyone for a while &mdash; I went into a 
shell. even today, I look at people lurking in shadows suspiciously, lock all the doors in the house, etc. But that feeling of 
being safe in my own home is gone.</p>

<h3>drug addiction</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to be addicted 
to drugs?</h2>
Dan Holliday, Please pull around to the second window.</b>
<p><b>Stages. Everything comes in stages.</b><br/>
I was always such a prude. no, not a sex prude, but a drug/
alcohol prude as a kid. My best friend and I (in fact, my entire 
circle of friends) were pretty snooty about any addictive substances. I made it through high school without ever touching 
tobacco or any "street drugs." I remember refusing to take 
pain killers after surgery. I didn't drink that much (though, I 
don't ever deny having drunk alcohol in high school). Generally, I was well-focused in that regard.</p>
<p>I remember seeing the 
<i>stoners </i>in high school and laughing at them and calling them losers. I remember wondering 
what, WHAT!, in the hell were they thinking. <i>How messed up 
can you get? </i></p>
<p>I made it through early adulthood. I passed my twentyfirst birthday and still only drank ("only" meaning that I 
drank on weekends, but not much beyond). never drugs. I 
watched some guys do drugs and just wondered what the hell 
they were thinking. Seriously, one time I watched guys smoke 
some weed, and I got all nervous and had to leave a party. I 
just didn't touch any drugs. </p>
<p>Twenty-first year. Twenty-second year. And then my twenty-third year. I was living in Key West. I started drinking 
heavily. See, KW doesn't really have that much to do beyond 
ocean stuff and night life. I really partied a lot. And tons of 
guys were popping these newish pills called "ex" (they called 
it that in Key West) and it seemed so easy and they really 
seemed to enjoy the stuff. But the thought of it just made me 
shudder. </p>
<p><i>I didn't do drugs.</i><br/>
And damn, I kept thinking about how much fun it looked 
like they were having. So, my friend at the time (a lady I still 
talk to who, herself, has moved well beyond that era) was sort 
of in a relationship with some French Canadians living in the 
Keys who had a whole "business" going that was focused just 
on ecstasy. And you have to remember, the US Federal Government at this time hadn't even caught up with the stuff; it 
was still something like Schedule 2 or 3. It was not a high 
priority.<br/>
And given how it didn't seem to have any weird side effects, I finally gave in to the curiosity and asked to buy a pill&dagger;. 
That was a big deal. The big night came, and I took it. Tick 
tock, tick tock. nothing. Another hour went by and nothing. 
Damn, and by the time we realized that it was not going to 
happen, there weren't anymore connections. Shit. What a 
waste of fifteen bucks!! Worked for everybody else, just not 
me. <br/>
So, the next weekend came and we were prepared: TWo
PILLS!!! We did that shit right and popped the pill right as 
I got to the club (I'm actually getting jittery thinking about 
it now). Tick tock. Tick tock. nothing. "GoDDAMn MAn! 
You must have an iron metabolism. no worry. We came prepared.  Second  pill . . .<b> CRUSHED</b>! now open up. This'll be a 
little gross buddy, but it's sure to . . . "<br/>
<i>Alllkkkkk! Splattt! Clakk! Grulp. Ugh.</i> oh, holy mother, 
there's nothing that can describe the horror, the absolute gagreflex-inducing, hellish, <i>bitternesss </i>of a crushed up pill of ecstasy in the mouth. Aspirin doesn't even come close. That shit 
was horrible. <br/>
Then suddenly after swallowing the crushed-up <i>deathtasting </i>powder,<b> it hit me</b>. "Wait a second, even a crushed-up 
pill of ex can't hit you that fast. <i>Oh SHIT! </i>That's the <i>first </i>pill 
kicking in. oH GoDDAMn, DAn! You gotta hold on buddy 
because when the second dose kicks in, you're gonna be in for 
a hell of a night."<br/>
<i>This is why I'm still an addict. This is why I will be "in 
recovery" for the remainder of my life. As I type this answer, 
an answer I've had marked to answer for a while, my eyes are 
dilating and my hands are shuddering so much that I have to 
get up and take a break. My right leg has been bouncing on the 
floor so hard and so fast that my boyfriend had to walk into 
the office to find out what the pounding was . . . He knows. He 
knows me well. He knows this emotional force emanating from 
me right now like coronal flares. He hates it and wisely fears it 
because conversations about this subject should induce horror 
or shame or fear, but this specific drug and conversations thereabout always inspire poetic, fantastical, whimsical language 
in me of joy and excitement that aren't in line with the reality 
that was, with the reality that I make myself remember in order 
to remind me that the reality and the memories were always 
worlds apart. NOTHING about this isn't exciting right now. 
That's something he rightly fears, though having never seen the 
addict. I've been clean for eleven years.</i><br/>
From that moment in time, from that moment forward 
for the next four years and four months and three days, <i>I was 
a barely functioning (and rarely functioning) drug addict</i>. I 
didn't stop. every weekend for the next four years was spent 
on some kind of drug, culminating in the last year of my life 
spent endlessly on drugs and at times without a home. But 
we're not there yet. We're at the fun stage where no problems 
seem to be caused by the drug. <br/>
only good times. And that night was a really good time. 
The intensity of pleasure and joy and connection I felt with 
those people in that minute was profound. That's what 
MDMA does. I know it's history. The Dan Holliday who 
spouts proudly his knowledge of history existed back then as 
well as today. <br/>
<i>3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine</i> was invented a 
long time ago. In fact, it's celebrating its one hundred year anniversary this year, 2012. Invented in Germany as a test drug 
for treating psychological issues, it is highly "empathogenic," 
meaning that it just makes you a happy, cuddly, loving person 
while you're on it. I've witnessed, live, many closed, shy, homophobic, hateful, angry people turn about and confront their 
inner hangups about things and become the happiest people 
I ever knew. ecstasy just has that effect. You cannot hate on 
that shit.<br/>
And I used and used. I burned through thousands . . . oh so 
many thousands of dollars over the next few years. night after night, week after week. The intervening two-ish years are 
unimportant because they were all repeats of the same night 
over and over again. <br/>
<i>Until I met Luke. </i><br/>
no, his name isn't Luke. It could be Tommy or Jake or 
omar or Juan. But we're calling him Luke because his name 
really isn't important. Luke was a good guy, I mean it. A 
heart of gold, but just misguided as I was at that time. Luke 
was, well, he was my dream guy: very attractive, friendly, 
gay friendly in fact, and totally straight. We were instantly 
friends. Luke was well ahead of me in self-destructiveness, 
and he'd had a love affair with meth and coke for a while.<br/>
ever wonder how a person who "fears" a thing can instantly break down their barriers stopping them from doing 
that "thing"? <i>Lust</i>. I don't know a single person on earth who 
hasn't engaged in the stupidest shit over lust, and I lusted 
after Luke. Luke's all I thought about. on our second night 
hanging out, we went to a gay bar and Luke did something 
that utterly melted my heart and &mdash; from that moment on &mdash; 
made me completely infatuated with him . . .<i> addicted to him</i>
in ways more powerful than drugs. <br/>
At the club, I could see that he was a bit loopy. Heart 
beating faster than it should. The pulsing being visible in the 
way he was breathing and the veins in his neck. I was curious, 
<i>so I asked</i>. Without a second thought, he grabbed my hand 
and put it on his chest to feel his heart. <i>Pounding. Pounding. 
Pounding. </i>nothing about that powerful of a heartbeat is safe. 
A goddamned battering ram pushing through his rib cage. <br/>
It's been thirteen years since that day. Humans have been 
born and entered puberty. A global war on terror has come 
and nearly gone. Millions of lives have entered and left the 
earth. Regimes have changed and taken the course of history 
with them.<br/>
<i>Thirteen years is a long time. But I remember. </i><br/>
I remember every person in the bar, what I was wearing, 
what he was wearing, the music, our drinks, the looks (Luke 
always got lots of looks), the conversation, <i>and his face</i>. I call 
that a "crystal moment" (appropriately coincidental considering the subject matter). I felt his heart through his chest, and 
every muscle on his chest. Luke didn't think about what he 
was doing and had no clue what I was really feeling. He was 
just a guy, but my hand on his chest feeling his heart beat 
made me completely enslaved from that moment on. Luke, 
<i>beautiful Luke</i>, was on meth that night. <br/>
<i>I wasn't far behind. </i><br/>
The next day, we snorted crystal together.&Dagger; A week later, 
we did coke. Within a few months, I had lied to my wealthy 
grandfather and convinced him to send me a sizable chunk 
of change. All of which was spent on drugs. Huge Christmas 
gifts came in from the same grandfather (by "huge," I mean: 
new car or down payments on houses, big). All of it spent on 
drugs. All of it spent on Luke. <br/>
And then the money started running out, and I'd lost my 
job and I'd moved out of my one stable friend's house (who 
was, himself, extremely worried about me). I'd stopped talking with my family. I'd stopped eating right. I started losing 
weight. Weeknights and weekends were spent "casually" using meth, while spending the entire weekend at raves or after 
hours night clubs in Phoenix that catered to drug users. <br/>
I was there, and it was so exciting. Then, somewhere along 
the way, the ecstasy stopped being as fun, and I'd switched to 
"just coke and meth" (because I didn't want that drunk feeling). And along the way, I'd stopped parachuting meth (putting a few grains in a wad of toilet paper or napkin and swallowing it like a pill). I'd switched to smoking it out of a pipe. 
And along the way, I'd begun using (not going to spell it out) 
<i>alternate methods </i>to make income and pay for my addiction.<br/>
And I wasn't one of those stupid drug addicts in denial. I 
knew full well I was addicted and admitted and talked about 
it. I laughed about it. I made art about it. I wrote poems about 
it. I was never in denial, <i>I just didn't care. </i><br/>
And then I lost my house. And then I lost my car. And 
then I had to start sleeping on a buddy's couch because I had 
nowhere else to go. My friend, Luke, stopped being my friend 
and like a shot in the head, I spiraled out of control. It took 
YeARS to admit that I was in love with Luke, but not then, I 
was in denial (about a great deal). I started completely numbing myself with more and more meth. I smoked a full 8-ball 
a day (8th of an ounce &mdash; enough to keep an ordinary person 
strung out for a week). I'd lost all my friends. <br/>
My apartment had been robbed long ago and all my good 
shit was stolen, so I couldn't sell that. And everything, eVeRYTHInG was just completely lost. FUBAR. even my last 
friend, the guy whose couch I'd been sleeping on, had had 
enough of me. I was so emotional (drug emotions are like 
being severely bipolar &mdash; indistinguishable, in fact). I was up 
and down. I was insane and incorrigible. I was alone and on 
the verge of just killing myself. It was so painful. I remember wanting out and not knowing how; trapped in a world 
of drugs, drug selling, and the caramel river of one pointless 
day oozing into the next, without enough velocity to crush me 
against the rocks, but not solid enough for me to get a grip 
and swim to shore.<br/>
People were looking for me. I owed money. Goddamn, I 
owed so much money to so many people. Death was the quickest and easiest way out. I'd spent my last relationship. I had 
nothing left, and the years that I should have spent doing 
something of value were spent doing nothing of any worth 
and so, having no recourse, I'd decided that I was just going 
to kill myself. <br/>
<i>And I called my dad to say goodbye. </i><br/>
We hadn't spoken in years. Three-ish years. I was certain 
he'd written me off. I was always more than the black sheep; 
the pink sheep, of the family. I never fell in line. I never ever 
feared being different, and I didn't have a problem making 
other people suffer for me being different; <i>so what would he 
care if I was gone?<br/>
Biology.</i><br/>
So many people make so much of biology. My dad who 
raised me was not my biological father. At something like 
when I was a month old, my mother left my biological father. 
At something like when I was nine months old, my mother 
met my dad and as far as both of them tell me, I instantly considered him my dad. The other guy wasn't around, and when 
he finally showed his face, I'd already bonded with my dad. 
The other guy was just a sperm donor.<br/>
My dad was there through it all. When I was attacked by 
dogs, he stayed with me through the surgeries. When we were 
in a car accident and my mother was killed, he was our rock. 
When I struggled in my early teen years with letting go of my 
mother, he held out and gave love to this irascible, splenetic 
teenage boy. And while he wasn't a perfect dad (and who the 
hell gets to put that kind of pressure on father? How dare I 
make that demand as a kid, as if I could ever do better), he 
was a great dad to a less than great kid. <br/>
<i>Biology. </i><br/>
And so much is made of biology, like our connections are 
defined by chemical similarities within our cells and <b>not </b>by 
shared experiences and shared pains and time-well-spent together. In my head, I'd convinced myself that I wasn't "really 
one of his," that he'd written me off. <i>He wouldn't care</i>. <i>Why 
would he, after all I've done? </i>He had his "real" kids (and never 
did he ever, eVeR make that distinction between any of us). <br/>
none of you have any clue what it means<i> to know what a 
dad is </i>until you've pushed that relationship so far; sullied it; 
cursed it; insulted it; belittled it; lied to it; used it; pissed and 
shit on it; defiled it in ways that rightly IT SHoULD noT 
Be THeRe, that rightly you should have been left rotting 
in a ditch for what you'd done . . . only to turn around and 
find a granite block of unmovable, unbending, unstoppable 
love . . .<i> and arms </i>wrapped so tightly around you that for the 
first time in years, you realize you were never alone and that 
you'd never fall.<br/>
<i>And my dad caught me before I hit the ground.</i></p>
<p>&dagger; I kept a journal for a period of four years of my life 
throughout my drug use &mdash; yeah, VeRY Basketball Diaries &mdash; and I tracked with intricate detail the pills I took. 
First pill was a "Pink elephant."<br/>
&Dagger;
Burn? BURn!? oh my. You have no idea.</p>

<h3>alcoholism</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be an alcoholic?</h2>
Karen Opas, Editor, writer, &amp; clumsy typist</b>
<p>What's it like to be an alcoholic? At first, it's great. Truly, truly wonderful. A few glasses of the magic potion and suddenly 
I was relaxed, happy, having fun, and supremely confident. 
Alcohol <i> answered</i> something in me. It took away my everypresent anxiety. I could be in the moment. I was thirteen the 
first time I experienced just how sublime being drunk could 
be.</p>
<p>I could drink a lot (comparatively) without showing it. At 
fifteen, I was at a bush party where a girlfriend was raped by 
her date &mdash; she was so drunk that she couldn't fight him off &mdash; 
and I remember judging her for getting so drunk, rather than 
sympathizing.</p>
<p>I turned seventeen and finished high school at the same 
time. My father told me I could no longer live in the family 
home. I went on a drunken tour of europe for a few months 
and then moved to Banff, where I worked, drank, and drugged. 
By my seventeenth summer, I was drinking three to four bottles of wine at least five times a week and taking speed to prevent blackouts. But drinking was still fun. I was with a young, 
beautiful, and hard partying crowd. What I did was normal 
in context. There were some bad hangovers, a few guys I slept 
with that I regretted, and a night in the drunk tank when the 
RCMP found me literally crawling home in skirt and t-shirt 
in mid-January (think it was about -25 Celsius that night) and 
I was too drunk to tell them were I lived. They probably saved 
my life (or at least a few fingers and toes).</p>
<p>A couple of years later, my friends were leaving 
Banff, giving up the partying and heading to university, 
careers,marriage, mortgages, kids, and all the grown up stuff. 
And some of them were suggesting that I might be partying a 
bit too hard. I dismissed them as boring a-holes.</p>
<p>But life in a ski town wasn't so much fun anymore, so I 
went to university. In order to make the money to go there, I 
headed up to Yellowknife to tend bar at the Gold Range. The 
way the patrons drank made my drinking seem the epitome 
of restraint. So, I was able to tell myself that I didn't have a 
drinking problem. When I started university, I got a part-time 
job serving tables at the bar where the CFL and nHL players partied. once again, my drinking and drug habits seemed 
pretty normal. I dated a player (who would later be booted 
out of the league for his coke use) who liked that "I could keep 
up with him." I told myself that I didn't have a problem with 
drinking because I only drank when I was with other people, 
so I was a social drinker. ReAL alcoholics drank alone &mdash; but 
I had groups of "friends" who lived by different clocks. I could 
always find people to drink with.</p>
<p>I was twenty-one and drinking was still, mostly, fun. I was 
getting great grades. But there were warning signs; people 
I wouldn't hang out with because they were boring (didn't 
drink more than a glass or two on weeknights), classes I 
missed because I was too hungover to make it in, I had to 
borrow money to pay rent and bills, because I was spending 
my earnings and savings on booze and drugs. Time passed; 
I dropped out of university because, I told myself, "I don't 
want this." Actually, I was failing that semester because I was 
drinking and drugging so heavily that I couldn't do course 
work or pass exams. </p>
<p>So then, like countless alcoholics before and since, I decided that the problem wasn't me, it was where I lived. So I 
moved. But no matter where you go, there you are. I was able 
to stop doing coke and speed in my new town, but my drinking got even heavier to compensate. oh, and drinking no longer worked its old magic. I had to drink so as not to go crazy, 
but it didn't make me feel good, it didn't fill me with warmth 
and good cheer. It had become a dreary necessity.</p>
<p>Drinking pretty much took over my life. I had a few 
friends who drank as hard as I did. We prided ourselves on 
it and thought the rest of the world were boring sheep with 
no sense of adventure. I did things I was ashamed of. Maybe 
not the stuff you might be ashamed of &mdash; sex was as meaningless as drinking a glass of water by then &mdash; but stealing from 
friends and convincing myself it wasn't theft, that they owed 
me or would want me to have it. I was best woman at a childhood friend's wedding, and I didn't show up for the ceremony. 
I had gotten drunk the night before and, truthfully, didn't 
want to stand up and watch someone be happy and move forward in life. I coveted happiness and hated everyone else for 
having a better life than I did. I hated myself even more. And 
the only thing I knew how to do was pick up a bottle. </p>
<p>Alcoholism is lonely. even when you are surrounded by 
people, you don't feel the connection. even when those people 
really love you. Because you think they love the mask you are 
holding up to the world, not the real you, not the worm inside 
that is your core self. And I drank even harder to get rid of 
that realization. </p>
<p>Being an alcoholic is tedious and fearful. I lived in fear 
of being found out, and I had to plan every activity to make 
sure that there was access to alcohol. I'd show up at parties 
and drop a bottle of wine on the table. Then I'd head to the 
bathroom and stash a bottle of scotch inside the toilet tank so 
that I didn't have to worry about running out of booze. And 
people wouldn't know just how much I was drinking. over a 
decade later, I still know the closing hours of all the liquor 
stores in Vancouver! </p>
<p>Twice, during the last five years of my drinking, I managed to stop for about a month. But the entire time, there was 
a hamster wheel in my head, one that kept repeating, "I am 
not drinking. I am not drinking." The only thing I thought 
about was booze. And how horrible it was not to be drinking 
any.</p>
<p>I can tell a lot of funny stories about my drinking years. 
But most of the time I was scared, alone, angry, and bored. I 
<i>knew</i> the future that was coming was a bad one. And then I 
had that moment of clarity. I almost choked to death on my 
own vomit, and I realized that I would die if I kept drinking 
and that I didn't want to die like this. The long process of 
recovery began. Recovery is amazing and it is brutal. I had to 
grow up and become a whole person, so that I didn't try and 
fill the black hole at my core with booze, drugs, sex, drama, 
and all the other distractions I had used. Growing up isn't 
easy, especially when you are twenty years behind the curve. 
But it is possible, as long as I put in the daily work. </p>
<p>Today, I have a wonderful sober life with great friends, a 
marriage full of fun and love, interesting, meaningful work, 
and a comfy home. And I believe that I could lose everything if 
I decide to pick up a drink again. Maybe that belief is wrong, 
but I've seen friends who started drinking again be just as bad 
or worse as they had been in a very short time and their family, careers, and bank accounts disappeared. </p>
<p>Sometimes people ask me if I couldn't just have one glass 
of wine, how do I know that I would have the same problems 
with booze after all these years? I usually answer with this, <i>"If 
you could play a slot machine that might reward you with a 
small payout, say $20, but if you got the wrong combination 
your right thumb got chopped off, would you do it?"</i> nobody's 
ever said they'd play those odds. And neither will I.</p>

<h3>asperger syndrome</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to have 
Asperger's Syndrome?</h2>
Alex K. Chen, InquilineKea/Simfish
<p>You have absolutely zero social intuition (and not just that 
&mdash; but you don't even notice the social cues that allow you to 
develop that social intuition). As a result, every social situation feels like a potentially awkward situation where you 
don't know what to do or say (especially when it's so hard 
to enjoy the things that other people enjoy &mdash; and forcing 
yourself to enjoy what they enjoy doesn't work at all either). 
It feels like you can only get social interaction through academia, asking questions, trolling/creating drama, attention 
whoring, playing computer games, or eavesdropping/stalking.</p></b>
<p>So normally, I just end up studying or reading most of the 
time &mdash; even when I'm in parties. With that all said, the survival techniques I've used to interact with people have gone a 
long way over the years. In most normal social situations, for 
example, I simply don't know what to do other than ask questions. But this survival tactic has caused me to develop such 
a strong talent in asking questions that I've asked more questions than anyone else on Quora and on many other forums. 
I'm also known for my questions in Academia too (especially 
in academic conferences) &mdash; I guess all the practice in asking 
questions has gotten to the point that I my questions made 
a sufficiently strong impression on a number of professors, 
and that skill did make me win a top student fellowship at a 
certain university.</p>
<p>nonetheless, we can often only rely on unnatural ways 
of getting information (<b>especially</b> the type of "hidden" social 
information that you can't get from reading a book or website), and some neurotypicals object to the covert ways that 
we sometimes use to get that information. nothing gets me 
angrier at humanity than the objections they use against how 
we try to obtain that hidden social information, but *shrug* I 
guess it's part of life. </p>
<p>The other thing is that it's often profoundly isolating to 
realize that almost no one in the world is going to fully appreciate the obsession that you have with your particular set of 
interests (and with the particular <b>details </b>about your interests, 
too). no &mdash; not even people in Academia (nor other Aspies for 
that matter) will appreciate the particular ways that you're 
obsessed with your interests. And the truth is that us Aspies 
also probably aren't ever going to be able to appreciate the interests of neurotypicals in the ways they carry out their interests. So the end result is that many of us prefer doing things 
by ourselves. Unless we're playing multiplayer computer 
games. oftentimes, people in computer games (like Starcraft
II) actually appreciate the fine details of things in Aspie-like 
detail. This definitely happened when I played Age of empires II, although I ultimately suck at multiplayer games so I 
quit competitive multiplayer. With that all said, the Internet 
allows us to broadcast the details of our interests that we're 
most obsessed with, and we can *at least* theorize of the theoretical possibility that there might be someone out there who 
appreciates things in the same ways that we appreciate them. </p>
<p>oftentimes, I get along particularly well with foreign students, since being an Aspie is surprisingly similar to being a 
foreign student in your own country. As long as the foreign 
students don't have a bunch of other foreign students to hang 
out with, at least. With foreign students, it's <b>okay</b> if a situation is awkward.</p>
<p>People, even those who really like me, always try to keep 
some distance from me. I definitely notice it, and it often 
hurts. It has sometimes gotten me angry at the entirety of 
humanity in the past. But I don't know &mdash; at least Academia 
keeps you sufficiently busy that you always manage to find 
someone else so that you'll forget your anger at people who 
ignore you. </p>
<p>I've actually noticed that a number of Aspies can often become prolific trolls as well &mdash; since trolling is often one of the 
only ways they can get people to enjoy their presence (and it 
often works, quite well, too!). It's <b>much</b> easier to get someone 
to actually laugh at something you say or do (and for a legit 
reason too) by trolling than by doing something else. Most 
Aspies seem to troll in a way different from that of most neurotypicals, but it's hard to describe. </p>
<p>It often does feel profoundly isolating, but as Simon Baron-Cohen once said on edge.org, the Internet is super-liberating for all of us. For me in particular, I guess I can usually be 
okay since I have the combination of Internet and Academia.</p>
<p>one thing I'm known for doing is posting sprees of 
threads, questions, or status updates. I have almost no intuition for whether or not people will actually like my content 
(and the most-followed/liked items often surprise me), so I 
end up with a very low signal to noise ratio on many of my 
questions/status updates.</p>
<p>And we certainly do appreciate the recognition that a lot 
of people on the Internet and in educational institutions that 
people have for Aspies. I used to use Asperger's Syndrome 
as an excuse for everything, but I no longer use it very much 
because I started feeling ASHAMeD of doing that, because 
having Asperger's doesn't always excuse us from at least <b>trying</b> to understand others a bit more. nonetheless, I've learned 
that even when I <b>do</b> try to understand others more, I'll still be 
different, and unfortunately, there's no way around that, so 
maybe I'll just have to mention it to others. <b>At least</b> a lot of 
people do try to accommodate themselves to us Aspies, even 
though we'll probably never be close to anyone (but over Academia/the Internet, that's okay).</p>
I also have ADD, so *that* often makes certain aspects of 
ASD more "severe." I don't know how to describe it yet.

<h3>asperger syndrome</h3>
<b><h2>What is it like to be in a 
relationship with someone who has 
Asperger's?</h2>
Laura Copeland, had some relationships<br/>
Heartbreaking.</b>
<p>I went to high school in the least glamorous part of California, in a rural town with no shortage of dairy farms, meth 
labs, and Pontiac GTos sporting 20-inch rims. I was the only 
nerd for miles and miles, I thought, until I met Aaron Smith.</p>
<p>Aaron was 6'2", blue-eyed, well-read, and willing to play 
Scrabble with me for six hours straight without a break. His 
cerebral traits alone would've made me putty in his hands, but 
I would soon discover that Aaron had scissorhands, useless for 
playing with putty.</p>
<p>Most days Aaron sat in the back of our French class, staring out a tiny window in the door. He didn't speak unless 
called on, and then he'd respond with some brilliant comment 
to show he wasn't missing any class discussion.</p>
<p>Aaron came and left the second the bell rang, so I never 
saw him up-close, not until the end of the quarter, when we 
sat next to each other for a midterm in the computer lab. I 
finished early and glanced at his screen: He was finished, too, 
and had a web browser open to LiveJournal. Intrigued that 
someone else had an account on the site &mdash; and wasn't afraid, 
like I was, of using it in front of our peers &mdash; I committed his 
username to memory and looked it up when I got home.</p>
<p>His entries were long and lovely, full of eloquent thoughts 
on philosophy and literature and a bucket-list wish to live in 
Asia. I left a flattering comment identifying myself, and then 
I added the screen name in Aaron's profile to my AIM buddy 
list.</p>
<p>Before long we were chatting all the time, late into the 
night, and playing marathon Scrabble games online. I grew 
to value him as a person with whom I could talk about <i>real</i>
things, like Isaac Asimov and Ayn Rand and whether happiness was all an illusion (yes, my new friend said, and we can't 
be trusted to measure our own). In a place where it seemed 
nobody else knew what books were, I'd found my kindred 
spirit in Aaron.</p>
<p>our online closeness never parlayed into a friendship at 
school, though. one of us would say hi when the other walked 
into the room, and sometimes we'd wave to each other in the 
halls, but I was too shy to talk to him at length in person, 
and French was our only period together. The rest of Aaron's 
day was spent in a portable classroom with the kid who had 
Down syndrome and a girl I knew from art class who was 
always writing letters to her father in prison. Aaron didn't 
show any signs of a broken home life or an intellectual disability &mdash; quite the opposite, actually &mdash; so I never thought to 
ask what the deal was with the separate class. I just assumed 
he was there for some behavioral issue. Maybe he did drugs.</p>
<p>Both of us skipped our senior year and left for college 
early, and thanks to late-starting schedules, we were staying 
up chatting even later. I started hinting that we should meet 
up the next time we were both back home, like in real life, at 
my favorite hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. Several months had 
passed since graduation, and I missed the guy.</p>
"no, I don't drink coffee," he typed.
<p>"Me either, but this place has a really good drink with 
little candy-bar bits. It doesn't even taste like coffee."<br/>
"Why would you order coffee if it doesn't taste like coffee?"<br/>
"or you could get tea or whatever," I wrote back. "It'd just 
be fun to hang out."<br/>
I had these scuffles with him every now and again. They 
didn't deter my pursuit. To put it crudely, I knew I was Aaron's only opportunity to get laid &mdash; intellectual teenage guys 
are still teenage guys, and in my experience driven by one 
thing &mdash; so I figured he must just be playing hard to get. eventually, I got him to commit to meeting me for tea.<br/>
It was a warm fall day, so I laid out my beat-up board on 
one of the patio tables on the wrap-around porch at Queen 
Bean. I was happy to see Aaron when he walked up, and even 
happier when his Scrabble skills proved just as polished in 
person. neither of us said much after some initial catching up 
&mdash; plus some shit-talking on my part, which Aaron never reciprocated &mdash; but I was actually relieved that there wasn't any 
pressure to keep a constant conversation going. I'm always a 
bit suspicious of people who are excessively chatty. Plus, I had 
to pay close attention during our games, or my inevitable loss 
would be even more shameful.<br/>
At one point, another regular at the cafe recognized me, 
and she came over to say hi and check out the game. Aaron 
apparently felt no need to be friendly to my other friend. He 
just sat there, solemnly staring, and offered only the slightest 
and awkwardest smile when I made introductions. My other 
friend would later ask who Aaron was, exactly, because he 
seemed, um, kinda weird.<br/>
But I was weird, too, in my own way. Isn't everyone? Aaron's awkwardness didn't faze me, and it didn't change the fact 
that he was hot, smart, had an excellent memory for little 
things I told him, and seemed entertained by the god-awful 
crazy shit I wrote in my Livejournal. He'd memorized the 
minutiae from my day-to-day life, and that meant more to 
me than his grace with strangers. It also meant he liked me, 
right? Maybe he was just uncomfortable at cafes.<br/>
"I'm feeling kinda stir-crazy, sitting here this long," I said 
after he'd beaten me at a second game. "What about you?"<br/>
"no," Aaron said. "I'm not stir-crazy."<br/>
We had half a dozen exchanges like this before I decided 
to lead the horse to water and directly assert what I'd been 
hinting: that we go back to his place. oK, he said. I followed 
him there in my own car and spent most of the drive secondguessing myself. Was I being too pushy?<br/>
The sun had set in the ten minutes it took us to get there, 
and it was dark by the time we pulled up to the small duplex 
Aaron shared with his mother (another thing we had in common: I lived in close quarters with a single mom, too). Mrs. 
Smith was a mystery shopper, Aaron told me as he unlocked 
the door, and wouldn't be back for a while.<br/>
The living room was dark, with low ceilings and wall-towall bookshelves. A futon, covered in lint and too small for 
someone Aaron's height, was left open in the middle of the 
room. The frame dug into my pant legs when I sat down.<br/>
Aaron never took a seat, preferring instead to pace. These 
are my books, he told me, fingering their spines and pulling 
out a few, one at a time. Most were scifi novels, and he recounted their plots in painful detail. You'd like this one, he 
said. He said it about every book he showed me, indiscriminately, even though he knew I didn't care for the genre. This 
went on for a couple hours.<br/>
I waited and waited for something more to happen, but 
nothing ever did, not even when I got him, walked over to 
him, stood close and tried to <i>will</i> my friend out of his shell. I 
didn't just want to hook up; I would've taken emotional closeness, too, even the platonic kind that grows from discussing 
shared life experiences. I tried taking the lead again &mdash; what 
kind of music do you like? what do you want to do after college? &mdash; but Aaron would deflect my questions with one-word 
answers and go back to talking about the books. He didn't listen to music, he said. But this one, this book, it's really great, 
he said. When was he going to stop talking about the books? 
even a book<i>seller</i> at a book<i>shop</i> would've at least asked what 
brought me into the store that day.<br/>
The more Aaron talked, the more I was broken down by 
self-doubt: I'm not this guy's intellectual equal, after all. I'm 
not pretty enough. I spend too much time online, and now 
I've lost the art of interacting with live human beings. I left, 
crestfallen, when he was holding <i>Of Men and Monsters</i> in his 
hands and telling me about a society where the humans had 
turned into vermin living in the walls of monster's houses.<br/>
I'm an average-looking girl, maybe a little above-average, 
but certainly not some goddess who can get any guy she wants. 
My night with Aaron wasn't a disaster because we didn't hook 
up &mdash; that would've been normal and oK. It was a disaster because I felt like I was hanging out alone. I would've preferred 
he reject me.<br/>
Trainwreck dates are often described as ones where the 
couple "had no chemistry," but a more accurate description 
is to say that they had <i>bad</i> chemistry. They aren't the same. 
With Aaron, there really was no chemistry. And that void, 
that unknowing &mdash; it's much harder to swallow than rejection.<br/>
A few days after we hung out, when we were back to chatting on AIM, I learned that our evening together had been 
one of his more favorable social encounters.<br/>
He typed, "When you were at my house, did you want me 
to kiss you?"<br/>
Had I been twenty-seven, not seventeen, I would've explained to him &mdash; in plain language &mdash; that, yes, when a girl 
invites herself over, a girl who talks to you for hours online 
more nights than not, she wants you to kiss her. But I didn't 
say it. I backed my way out of the conversation and didn't talk 
to him again. Bitch move? Maybe. I have more empathy now. 
Back then I was in college, where well-read guys ran rampant. 
I didn't need the uphill battle.<br/>
A couple years ago, out of the blue, Aaron sent me this:</p>
<font size="-1"><p>I hope this is still your e-mail address. You know, I've discovered 
that overall I don't really like writing all that much. It sometimes depresses me. So I guess we have less in common than I 
first thought when we talked back in high school. Yeah, in fact a 
lot has changed, but I still wanted to catch up.</p>
<p>I don't know what's happened when we've tried to talk before 
&mdash; I'm sure I did something wrong &mdash; but if you'd like to start 
corresponding again, I've just rediscovered e-mail.</p>
I'm including a picture of nami from one Piece, because she 
reminds me of you every time I see her.</font>
<p>nami is a busty anime character with short orange hair. no 
resemblance, but the picture at least cleared up the mystery of 
whether Aaron found me attractive.</p>
<p>Since his address was now in my contacts list, he showed 
up as a suggested friend on Facebook. He has a master's in 
history now and lives in Japan, teaching english as an expat 
in a country where he doesn't speak the language.</p>
<p>I flicked through his photo albums, which look like what 
you get back when you develop the party-favor disposable 
cameras from a wedding that had an open bar &mdash; random 
shots of found objects, except without any shots of faces. 
Hundreds and hundreds of pictures spanning several years 
and not a single one contains another person. And the photos of Aaron, they're all self-portraits: his reflection in a car 
window, in a puddle on the sidewalk, in the mirror at a barbershop; his head in front of some Japanese tourist trap, his 
arm outstretched to fit everything in the frame. Where are his 
friends? Did he never get a girlfriend? Why was there never 
anyone around to take Aaron's picture?</p>
<p>I'm a journalist, and last year I interviewed a man with 
Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) who has lost his ability to speak, 
swallow, or move any body part but his eyes. He speaks 
through an optically controlled computer, blinking out a letter at a time, like Stephen Hawking does with his cheek. I 
never get scared of interviewing someone, but I was terrified 
of interviewing him.</p>
<p>Minutes after I arrived, though, the man's charm and humor had disarmed my nerves. Rather than wanting to leave, I 
wanted more time with him. The computer voice, the whooshing of the ventilator, the aide in the room, the delay before 
his replies &mdash; it all fades into the background and a warmth 
breaks through and <i>you can feel who he is</i>. It's no different 
than talking to anyone else.</p>
<p>Aaron has boundless advantages over a person in the late 
stages of ALS. He can change the volume and tone of his 
voice, laugh, crinkle his face, punctuate his sentences with 
hand gestures. He can tear across the room and give you a 
hug or a high-five or a slap on the ass. But you still can't feel 
who he is. Talking to him is worlds different from talking to 
anyone else. He's trapped in ice without a pick.</p>
<p>Despite what he said about losing interest in writing, Aaron still does it &mdash; hard habit to break &mdash; on a Wordpress blog 
that, bless his heart, shows up on the first page of search results for anyone who Googles his name. I spent a couple hours 
recently working my way back through the archives, just like 
I had ten years ago when I found his Livejournal. He's still a 
good writer, gifted at churning out honest prose.</p>
<p>on his new blog, in between blunt descriptions of a new 
nephew (who "came out of [Aaron's] sister's insides") and a 
night at the bar (he still hasn't discovered his tolerance for alcohol), I found a painful nugget of truth, a revealing two sentences on his failed attempts at dating. I read it and realized 
that, if given the option of being paralyzed in midlife from 
ALS or reaching old age with an autism spectrum disorder, 
I'd have to think hard before picking. <i>I don't know why I'm 
like this</i>, my old friend wrote. <i>It's like I'm deaf to a dog-whistle 
everyone else can hear</i>.</p>

<h3>family and families</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to have your 
sibling die?</h2>
John Clover, one day</b><br/>
Pretty miserable.
<p>My sister died at the age of eighteen when I was sixteen.
She was attending her first semester of college major<br/>
ing in Psychology at Florida State University when she came <br/>
down with mono.<br/>
She came home to recover and due to her weakened immune system she ended up with viral pneumonia. I only remember some bits so they may not fit together (I still remember the date she died as different from her official date of <br/>
death among other things), but as her symptoms worsened, <br/>
my parents contacted her doctor on a Friday, who said to wait <br/>
until Monday to come in, since the symptoms of the pneumonia were much the same as those of the mono.<br/>
My sister died before she could get to the doctor.
I remember my parents coming into my bedroom at night <br/>
and waking me up, saying "Rebecca isn't breathing!"
Like a good Boy Scout, I was always prepared. I stormed 
down the stairs, and went through the procedures I was certified for. My sister was on the floor next to the couch where 
she had been sleeping. There was fluid in her airway, I cleared 
it and began CPR. I told my parents to call 911 and continued <br/>
until the paramedics arrived.<br/>
I remember the stain on the floor next to her head where I <br/>
cleared her airway, and worrying about who would clean it up <br/>
so my parents wouldn't have to see it. I remember the sound <br/>
the air made as it left her lungs, like a balloon emptying out. <br/>
There was no resistance, no life. There seemed to be a glimmer of hope when the paramedics attempted to revive her <br/>
with shock paddles, but I think this was just wishful thinking.
We got in our car and followed them to the hospital where <br/>
after a short time we were moved to a grievance room where <br/>
we got to wait for a doctor to tell us what we already knew. It <br/>
was hell to wait.<br/>
We were brought to see her body and told to collect any <br/>
of her jewelry. It was the world's worst goodbye, even worse <br/>
for my other two sisters who were out of town and not able <br/>
to be present.<br/>
I had dreams she was still there, I would wake up thinking she was in the next room. I fantasized that she had been <br/>
kidnapped, and one day she would come back and we'd be <br/>
reunited.<br/>
I remember one of the last things I did for my sister and it <br/>
makes me happy. She was hungry and weak from being sick, <br/>
and I made her Kraft Mac and Cheese and she liked it. I'm <br/>
really glad that by sheer luck I wasn't a dick little brother and <br/>
that time, I made an effort to help her out.<br/>
I didn't cry and I didn't talk to anyone about my feelings. <br/>
She died in December of 1996, and I remember the first <br/>
time I cried was when I was driving to my friend's house and <br/>
Hale-Bopp was near perihelion (around Feb/April 1997), and <br/>
Lighting Crashes by Live was on the radio.<br/>
I pulled over and looked out my window at the comet, and <br/>
cried. I still can't listen to that song. I pulled myself together <br/>
and went to my friend's house and didn't cry again for I don't <br/>
know how long.<br/>
everything changed.<br/>
My mom started taking medication (it helped), my dad 
took anger management classes and started giving very awkward hugs, as if he hadn't been properly trained on when and 
how to deliver affection (he wasn't unaffectionate before, but 
apparently he must have been instructed that he was doing it 
wrong and he should instead be hugging people, it felt awkward and alien, almost funny at first). He's greatly improved <br/>
since then.<br/>
I was conscious of how I was suddenly treated differently <br/>
and most of the time I tried to make a conscious effort not to <br/>
take advantage of it. It was very easy to take advantage of the <br/>
situation, even by accident, and that made me feel even more <br/>
guilty, here I was making my life easier by taking advantage <br/>
of the miserable situation that my sister died.<br/>
I got away with being a pretty bad student because of my <br/>
"situation," and it wasn't my situation that was the problem it <br/>
was that I was a pretty crappy student.<br/>
I stopped going to Boy Scouts because I felt really awkward being around my peers, like it was easier to avoid them <br/>
than to make them feel obligated to console me or to try to <br/>
relate. I regret this.<br/>
every year I age, every new job I take, or adventure I go <br/>
on, I wonder what my sister would have been doing, two years <br/>
ahead of me. I like to think of her that way.<br/>
My family read her diary from college, and I refused to <br/>
read it. I knew there were entries she made in it about doing drugs and drinking as a freshman, and I didn't want to <br/>
remember her that way. She was the cheerleader who looked <br/>
out for her nerdy little brother and introduced him to Paula <br/>
Abdul and Michael Jackson. (All my sisters introduced me to <br/>
their favorite music, perhaps trying to convince me to pick a <br/>
side, and to this day I still love it all).<br/>
every day, and in everything I do, I ask myself if she would <br/>
be proud, if she would say, "Wow, John, that's awesome!"
It's a burden, but it's also a great driving force, it makes <br/>
me live my life.</p>

<h3>wealthy people and families</h3>
<b><h2>What's it like to come from a 
billion-dollar family?</h2>
John H. Hillman, V, sorry about the Roman numeral.</b>
<p><b>In my case it is pretty normal</b>
. To be clear, I am not "of the 
wealth" that flows through my family, I benefit from a minor 
tributary of the original fortune. I am not a poor person by 
any means, and I am super grateful for my family history, tradition, and the regional respect given towards us. Something 
that not only I, but the patriarch and matriarch Hillmans, 
have always tried to repay. <b>The reality is: the city that helped 
us, comes first.</b></p>
<p>Without giving a full family history &mdash; which has already 
been done way better than I could &mdash; the gist of it is: I had 
a relative seven or eight generations ago who did very well 
cooking iron in Kentucky/Tennessee in the 1850s. A generation continued that success though the U.S. Civil War with 
some pitfalls until around the 1900s when some southerner 
Hillmans traveled to a city which was a perfect fit for industrial steel revolution: Pittsburgh. When the U.S. steel industry 
began to slump beginning in the 1960s my great-uncle Henry 
diversified into many things, notably an early Kleiner Perkins 
investment, international real estate, and others. I believe he 
has been on the Forbes 400 since the first list, though I may 
be wrong. The rest can be found via Google.</p>
<p><b>How does it feel for me?</b>
 Aside from knowing that I come 
from solid stock, <i>which I try to live up to</i>, I have constant 
reminders such as the Hillman Library, which was named after my great-grandfather and is the main library of the University of Pittsburgh. The question I most often hear about 
that building is: "<i>Don't you like, own a library or something?</i>" 
other than that there is The Hillman Cancer Center, which 
is a fantastic facility, every once in awhile, I have misguided 
people<i> thanking me</i> because their cancer was "cured." I don't 
like that at all, it makes me feel uncomfortable. The Hillman 
Center for Future Generation Technologies part of Carnegie 
Mellon University is cool-looking (inside and out) and is a 
great partnership with Gates and CMU, but not something 
the average person cares about, including me. Then there are 
things like Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, part of the 
Carnegie Museum of natural History that are so amazing, 
but also made me feel awkward as a first grader visiting with 
my school. Kids can be tough. I could name over fifty other 
really important buildings/endowments/things our family's 
success has benefited, but most people don't care. And it can 
all be found without me telling you. </p>
<p>I have great friends. I can't clarify that enough. They 
are all lifelong friends who know me well. It isn't like I have 
hangers-on or people who want to be in my life because of a 
perceived wealth, though I believe others in my family might 
have that problem.</p>
<p>every month, I get a stranger that says "Hey, are you related to <i>the  Hillmans . . . ?" </i> or something like that. Basically I 
just go with the flow. I am modest, live a modest life, and it's 
all just fun and respect. Respect for my family and respect for 
people that are interested in "us." When I think of my family's 
fortunes I think of how much has been given back to Pittsburgh, and that is mainly how I identify with it.</p>

<h3>intelligence</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to be stupid?</h2>
Anon User</b><br/>
The following is a very unusual account of a true but unusual 
experience:
<p>I had an arterial problem for a couple of years, which 
reduced blood supply to my heart and brain and depleted B 
vitamins from my nerves (to keep the heart in good repair). 
Although there is some vagueness as to the mechanisms, this 
made me forgetful, slow, and easily overwhelmed. In short, I 
felt like I was stupid compared to what I was used to, and I 
was.</p>
<p>It was frightening at first because I knew something 
wasn't right, but didn't know what, and very worrying for my 
career because I was simply not very good any more.</p>
<p>However, once I got used to it and resigned myself, it was 
great. even though I knew I had a worrying illness, I was 
happy as a pig in mud. I no longer had the arrogance of being frustrated with slow people, I abandoned many projects, 
which reduced a lot of stress, I could enjoy films without 
knowing what would happen (my nickname before this used 
to be 'comic book guy' if you get the reference), and I became 
amazingly laid back and happy-go-lucky. I got on with people 
much better. I developed much more respect for one of my 
friends in particular who I always considered slow &mdash; it turned 
out he is much deeper than I thought, I just never had the 
patience to notice before. You could say I had more time to 
look around. The world just made more sense. The only negative, apart from struggling to perform at work, and having 
to write everything down, was that I no longer found sci-fi
interesting &mdash; it just didn't seem important. (I'm not joking, 
although it sounds like a <i>clich&eacute;</i>.)</p>
<p>eventually after more physical and life threatening symptoms developed, I got the right tests and they found my arteries were blocked up (two out of three of my main coronary 
arteries 100% blocked &mdash; they couldn't work out why I was 
alive &mdash; it later turned out that I had unusually good peripheral circulation from my intense cycling). I've since had stents 
to open up the arteries again and made a full recovery.</p>
<p>After a year or so, I am almost as 'clever' as I used to be, 
although I tend to ignore distractions more than I used to 
and focus on a smaller number of projects. I'm still more laid 
back than I used to be though, and have more patience with 
people. Most people still find me more socially competent. I 
also enjoy sci-fi again.</p>
<p>So an unusual perspective, from a fairly unusual circumstance, but that's what it feels like to be be stupid when you 
used to be fairly bright. In some ways, it was a great learning 
experience, although obviously in other ways it is a life changing fact I have to live with. not many people get to walk about 
in other peoples shoes, and then pick up where they left off. 
Plus it's obviously nice to still be alive.</p>
<p>In short, I would say that the frustration of dealing with 
slower people is worse than being one of the slower people, 
even if you know you are slow. obviously most people who are 
relatively slow don't know it, but I think I've glimpsed how 
they experience the world.</p>

<h3>attractiveness</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to be both 
very physically beautiful and very 
academically intelligent?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p><b>Being intelligent and attractive is a continuous test of character.</b> It's incredibly tempting to rely on your looks to get you 
places, and you have to make and adhere to a firm decision of 
not taking that ticket because you can. It's also really lonely. 
You can't really complain about it to anyone because to do 
so, you'd have to break the unspoken convention of never acknowledging your own beauty. even when writing this answer, I found myself wishing I could share it with friends but 
knowing that to do so would be socially unacceptable. When 
you're pretty, people mock you if you say anything negative 
about your looks, but they would find you stuck-up and intolerable if you actually admitted that you knew people found 
you attractive. </p>
how it affects your childhood
<p>If you have siblings, no matter how smart you are, you are 
"the pretty one." Your sister is jealous but you don't realize 
that's why she says things about how she's so much smarter 
than you are and that your parents think you're dumb in comparison. You grow up learning that looks matter a lot. My 
immigrant grandparent was prouder of my looks than my 
education, which was a startling truth to discover. All of your 
teachers love you and you can't really empathize with the students whom they don't like. </p>
how it affects your schooling
<p>My working style may not be perfect but I am very hard-working. I'm proud of both my looks and my mind but doubt each 
of them in different ways. For my looks, I try to not dwell on 
them as much as possible. I care about dressing well and never appearing like a slob but I'm disappointed in myself when 
I spend too much time in a mirror or too much time thinking 
about a compliment I've received. </p>
<p>When I was younger, I really didn't understand why people seemed to find me so attractive &mdash; I didn't fit the Barbie 
conventions of beauty that I was familiar with. In some ways 
it was almost easier back then, because I felt insecure about 
my appearance like all of my peers and considered their remarks on how jealous they were of me to be insincere. </p>
<p>When I grew out of my adolescence, I finally started to 
understand that in some objective way, I was very attractive 
to some non-zero portion of society. even though I still don't 
think of myself as beautiful in my heart-of-hearts, I've finally 
acknowledged to myself that I am to other people. Although 
this realization sounds very coming-of-age-y and like something you should congratulate me on ("You're no longer an 
insecure teenager who has body image issues!") it actually 
led to a lot of the self-doubt about my intelligence. Before, 
I struggled with the usual questions about how smart I was 
&mdash; was it just because I worked really hard? &mdash; but now I had 
new doubts. Was I only getting good grades because I was 
pretty? Did my teachers like me more because I had a great 
smile? How much did I really deserve my A+'s? My admission to a prestigious university made me unreasonably happy. 
There was no photo of me attached to the application &mdash; this 
was my moment to feel validated. The paranoid voice in your 
head whispers of letters of recommendation and grades and 
how they could be influenced by your attractiveness but you 
are deaf to them. </p>
<p>In college, there are occasional awkward moments with 
your TAs (I was lucky enough to never have anything too 
egregious with a professor). one TA for a lab told me that I 
had been going to do something that I shouldn't have and he 
had called my name to tell me to stop, but when I turned with 
a smile, he was kind of blindsided and let me carry on. I don't 
know how common this is though.</p>
how it affects you personally
<p>I alluded to this in the introduction, but having both looks 
and brains forces you to make a choice early on about how 
much you should use each to your advantage. I chose to develop my brain and try to the best of my ability ignore the effect 
that my appearance had on others. one thing I had to do after 
making that decision was figure out where to draw the line in 
terms of what kind of help and favors it's acceptable to accept 
and what kind are not. Pretty people have the advantage of 
others liking being around them and not having to repay any 
favors, as if their presence is enough. I wasn't able to help 
whether or not the people helping me were attracted to me or 
not but I did try and behave as much as possible like I didn't 
take their help for granted. For me, this meant that whenever 
a classmate helped me with my work or to understand the 
material, I made sure to do something to show my gratitude, 
whether it be by baking them cookies or by helping them with 
homework for another class. </p>
how it affects you intellectually
<p>Being intelligent and attractive can cause more pain than you 
realize. It's like the difference between humans and other animals, in that only we know that we'll someday die and dwell 
upon that. Similarly, as an intelligent person, I am fully aware 
of the fact that my beauty is ephemeral. In some ways, you 
look forward to being freed from the stifling weight of constantly worrying about your looks and how much your personal/intellectual merit has gotten you in life versus your looks. 
But mostly, you're afraid. I've never known a life of being unattractive to other people. I have no idea how much I've been 
living a "charmed life" or not because of them. I redouble my 
resolve to cultivate a mind so bright and a soul so light that 
even without my looks, I will be of value to my friends, family, 
and the world at large. <br/>
how it affects you professionally</p>
<p>More than they do for your college acceptances, a lot of people assume that you've gotten the position at the awesome 
company you're at in large part because of your appearance. 
These aren't even just strangers &mdash; when I was offered a job at 
a dream company, my friends' justification for it was that my 
future boss had a crush on me. Although I played it off like 
it was a joke, that was a devastating blow. I was pretty angry 
that they said and thought that AnD that they felt like it was 
perfectly acceptable to say, too. I wanted to remind them that 
I had been invited to interview at the company before they 
had any idea of what I looked like. </p>
<p>one of my friends is the child of a very, very successful 
parent. He and I would talk about using his parents' connections to get his foot in the door for things. His philosophy 
was that although it wasn't elegant, it wasn't unthinkable. He 
believed that because anyone else in his place would do the 
same, it wasn't reprehensible for him to do so. I've occasionally thought about that and if the same should apply to looks. So 
far, to the best of my conscious ability, I have avoided wielding 
my attractiveness as a tool for job-hunting. </p>
how it affects you socially
<p>Being both attractive and intelligent is a never-ending source 
of stress in high school. You wade between the popular crowd 
and the honors kids. It's an uneasy time, because your nerdy 
friends desperately despise your popular friends for having 
everything they think they want and your popular friends forget your nerdy friends even exist. Your popular friends are 
fun to be with because it's nice to not stand out too much. 
When you're only one pretty face in a group of pretty faces, 
you belong. But, you can't really party and date the quarterback if you want to do well in your classes and you really do 
want to do well in your classes. So, slowly, you drift to the 
smart kids side. You really count on your grades to give you a 
sense of worth, because you earned them in a way that you can 
never say of your looks.</p>
<p>Post high school, your mixture of looks and intelligence 
can still cause social pain. I had a roommate in college who 
once offhandedly told me that she would never introduce me 
to a guy she liked before they started dating. The strange 
thing was that she meant it as a compliment of sorts &mdash; that 
she thought he'd never fall for her if he met me first. But 
really, that made me feel pretty awful. nobody wants to unintentionally be the type of person that anyone is afraid to 
introduce their crush or significant other to. Likewise, it can 
be pretty tough to have close guy friends who have girlfriends. 
no matter how uninterested either/both of you are, the girlfriend feels threatened by your presence in his life. You hate 
causing strife, so you learn to back off as soon as one of your 
friends starts dating someone seriously.</p>
how it affects you romantically
<p>In terms of your love life, being both attractive and intelligent 
heavily influences both who/how you date and your outlook 
on dating in general. every pretty girl, intelligent or not, is 
used to the oafs who try to hit on them. The difference between the smart and pretty and the not smart but pretty is 
that the former attract more of the intelligent, nerdy guys. 
These guys are usually more well-intentioned than their oafish counterparts. They don't mean to make you uncomfortable 
with their spontaneous compliments. But some of them are 
less direct about what they want. We all know about these 
so-called "nice guys" who believe that they're being unfairly 
friend zoned. I suspect that these guys are, more often than 
not, guys of slightly above to vastly above average intelligence 
and as such, are drawn to the pretty and smart women. That 
means that we get to deal with them often.</p>
<p>Smart and attractive guys can be really hard to find and 
sometimes you have to compromise. I made the choice, more 
subconsciously than not, to optimize for intelligence in guys 
that I date rather than hotness. I've idly wondered if maybe 
the best guys for smart, beautiful women to date aren't actually the rich and successful ones. only they can really potentially understand what it's like to fear that you are loved for 
something other than your sparkling personality.</p>
<p>every now and then, you find a real gem of a boyfriend. 
He acts as though he's pulled the winning lottery ticket by 
catching a smart and beautiful girlfriend and is slow to take 
that for granted. Although you're pleased that he thinks you're 
beautiful, you occasionally have nagging doubts about how 
much he likes you for your looks versus your personality/intelligence. ("I mostly believe that he thinks I'm smart but would 
he date me if I weren't pretty too?") It's enough to make you 
a little paranoid and treat dating more cautiously than your 
other friends.</p>
<p>If a boyfriend didn't find me attractive, I'd be upset, but 
it's also of vital importance to me that he believe me to be very 
intelligent. This quotation in ethan Hein's answer is very apt: 
"As a female friend of mine once told me, 'The pretty ones 
want to be told they're smart, and the smart ones want to be 
told they're pretty.'"</p>
<p>This is a tough question to answer, like many of the other 
questions about personal experiences, because I don't know 
any other reality, but I gave it a fair shot. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, we really want you (you, as in, anyone whose opinion we respect and trust) to find us to be intelligent. Most of the compliments that I treasure the most are 
the ones which had something to do with my brain &mdash; a colleague who told me that he found my analysis to be incredibly 
insightful, a former classmate who mentioned my "brilliance" 
&mdash; these are the ones I hold dear. Most of the time, being attractive and intelligent is a very positive experience but I hope 
my answer gave you a peek into some of the less easy-to-guess 
aspects of this experience.</p>

<h3>unattractiveness</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to be 
unattractive and desired by none?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p>It's been truly awful. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of life.
I topped out a bit over 5' tall. As a male, that's the kiss of <br/>
death. Unlike other forms of unattractiveness, there's nothing <br/>
I can do about it. If you're overweight, you can try going to <br/>
the gym. Women who are concerned about their chest can get <br/>
that fixed. If you're a jackass, you can pretend to be nice for as <br/>
long as it's necessary. If you can't get an erection, just check <br/>
your email.<br/>
It's just completely capricious and unfair. If I were female, <br/>
it wouldn't be an issue at all. I can't think of a comparable <br/>
issue for women. It's also something that was largely out of <br/>
my control. <br/>
I'm smart, fairly well off financially, interesting, well-traveled, loyal and extremely generous . . . but all that hasn't been <br/>
able to overcome my height. The research shows that unless I <br/>
become a millionaire, I'm pretty much out of luck. If I could <br/>
spend $500,000 to become 5'10", I'd do it without thinking <br/>
twice.<br/>
Being short is a triple whammy because it affects two <br/>
other things that women value: confidence and clothes. While <br/>
I try to be confident, it is hard when you haven't had a lot of <br/>
success. Buying clothes is a real challenge and even with some <br/>
tailoring I have to wear clothes that are too big for me.
I remember one speed dating event where a woman spent <br/>
the whole ten minutes with me filing her nails and doing her <br/>
make up. I wasn't interested in her anyway, but geez. How <br/>
hard is it to be polite for ten minutes?<br/>
It feels like I have no choices, and I know that on a few <br/>
occasions, I've continued to pursue things that weren't great <br/>
because, hey, there was at least a bit of interest. note to self: <br/>
an atheist dating someone in seminary is not a good idea.
In a weird way, it's an invisible thing, despite being a completely visible thing. My friends (male and female) will make 
jokes about short men in front of me. While they wouldn't 
make such comments about race, sexuality, etc., it seems perfectly socially acceptable to mock short men. Hollywood regularly mocks short men and perpetuates negative stereotypes, 
despite the fact that many of Hollywood's leading men and 
other celebrities are short (Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman, Jon <br/>
Stewart, George Stephanopoulos).<br/>
There's also a lack of support, because my friends don't see <br/>
the issue. "It's all in your head." Undoubtedly, rejection after <br/>
rejection does take its toll on your psyche. I've tried going to <br/>
therapy. obviously, no amount of therapy can make me taller. <br/>
But it also hasn't helped because there's just no relatability. 
There are support groups for just about everything, but <br/>
I haven't been able to find any support for my challenges. In <br/>
watching the outpouring of support for bullied homosexuals, I can't help but think, "Why isn't anyone supporting me?" <br/>
(And, yes, I do support the bullied homosexuals.)<br/>
At least a couple of times in my life, guy friends have deserted me. As best as I've been able to tell it's because they felt <br/>
I was hurting their game.<br/>
A female friend once told me that it was kind of like winning the lottery. She meant that I had to keep playing. But <br/>
sometimes it does feel like my odds are like playing Powerball, which are a lot less than getting struck by lightning.
I sometimes get the sense that women, including attractive women, will let themselves get close to me because they <br/>
don't consider that I could possibly be interested in them. <br/>
That ends up being even more crushing.<br/>
I also get to hear female friends go on about what jerks <br/>
all men are, how they cheat, aren't trustworthy, etc. and I see <br/>
the jerks that women are willing to tolerate. That really grates <br/>
on me. <br/>
Being an unattractive man is especially hard because men <br/>
are the ones expected to make the first move. This means constantly being subjected to rejection.<br/>
outside the dating world, it just seems like things are <br/>
much easier for others. I can't quantify it, but it's a feeling <br/>
that sticks with me. People seem less willing to help unattractive people. I'm reminded of the 30 Rock episodes with <br/>
Jon Hamm, where people fall all over each other to do things <br/>
for him because he's attractive. <br/>
even moderately attractive female friends have expectations of what people will do for them that go way beyond what <br/>
I would expect people to do for me. This isn't a case of getting <br/>
what you give. I've been very generous to others, both with <br/>
time and money. I've learned not to expect that others would <br/>
do for me what I would do for them.<br/>
When I'm at parties with friends who have kids, it's pretty <br/>
common to hear them cooing about how big their kids have <br/>
gotten. I know it's not anything directly about me, but it's a <br/>
constant reinforcement of how important size is in our culture.</p>

<h3>sex</h3>
<b><h2>What's it like to pay for sex on a 
regular basis?</h2>
Anon User</b>
<p>I'm in a good position to answer this as I've probably seen 
around a hundred plus hookers since I was a teenager. I'm not 
proud of that, but not ashamed either. It is what it is.</p>
<p>What's it like to pay for sex on a regular basis? Hmmm. 
Disappointing. Thrilling. Painful. Fun. Abnormal. Pleasurable. Isolating. eventually, boring.</p>
<p>I was always of the school of thought that paying for it 
was more honest than sleazing on/trying to impress a girl 
all night in some sticky-floored nightclub with a dozen other 
guys all doing the same just to get into her pants. It always 
seemed undignified to me. Paying for the pleasure always 
seemed like playing on a more open and level playing field. 
The nature of the encounter was explicit &mdash; no pretense or 
flirting was necessary. To liken paying for sex as charity on 
my part would of course be ludicrous, but there was always a 
part of me that liked the fact that I could get what I wanted, 
and in return, they would be able to pay their rent, bills, whatever. Sometimes it really does seem like a win-win situation. 
I remember meeting some beautiful girls, full of personality, 
although those memories are always memories half-buried in 
the dank recesses of my long-term recall. If I could kid myself 
that all of the great times I had weren't about money, and 
didn't have the clock counting down in the background, then 
I could conceivably find myself grinning from ear-to-ear every 
day. But I can't, and along with those factors, the thing that 
most tarnishes my memories of my most passionate nights 
(sounds corny, but I can't think of how else to describe them) 
is that they were had when I was at my lowest ebb, broken-up, 
grieving, alone (I've been fighting clinical depression for the 
last seven years). <b>"Sex is the last refuge of the miserable,"</b>
Quentin Crisp said. All of my good nights were bittersweet.</p>
<p>And of course you get attached to some of them, love their 
foreign accent, their pep, their seemingly indefatigable lust 
for life and pleasure. Italian, South African, Czech, Hungarian, Brazilian, Spanish, Jamaican, Chinese, French, ethiopian, Swedish &mdash; all a phone call away. I remember a wonderful 
brothel in my hometown just a twenty minute bus ride away 
from my home that had a procession of lovely, petite girls that 
were fun to talk to and great in the sack (the petite part was 
important as I'm on the shorter side myself). The atmosphere 
was very sex-positive, almost communal. And I guess that's 
what helps to give the illusion of love &mdash; their availability. If 
you're lucky, they'll leave you with something to think about 
too, some little pearl of wisdom, some kind of reassurance, 
something with some little nugget of truth to it. I remember 
telling one woman that she should work as a counselor, not a 
prostitute, after I had opened up to her about how I was feeling about my car crash of a life and after she had given me 
some helpful words of advice. She was in her forties, Italian, 
and had kids. She turned round to me and said, "I am what 
I am and my life is my life." It was one of the most powerful 
things I had ever heard. A simple acceptance of her life without anxiety or judgement. You'd have to be pretty desperate to 
fall in love with them &mdash; at least, within the context of how you 
meet them &mdash; but a young man like me can cherish and love 
those words and those kinds of encounters that seem fraught 
with some greater significance brought about through shared 
feelings of being lost in an uncertain world. Actually, I always 
valued that as much as the sex. The connection, the conversation. I often never felt much different from the girls I was 
meeting. There was something wonderful about being able to 
be completely naked, physically and mentally, with someone 
lying across the bed from you, with no fear of judgement, or 
recriminations. </p>
<p>BUT, the last few encounters I've had have been awful, for 
reasons I won't go into here. The universe telling me to give 
it up, maybe. And I should. I should because I want to pursue 
a career in the medical field; I have aspirations to be a solid 
citizen &mdash; to grow out of being a idle denizen. I should because 
it hurts. It's probably the most spiritually damaging activity 
you could engage in, and I always wondered how these girls 
could be so tough to stand it. Prostitution demeans the punter 
and the working girl in almost equal measure. Like others 
have said, it's not real intimacy. There were many times when 
I would feel so dirty afterwards, many times when I knew 
the girl hated my guts, when I had knocked on their doors at 
three in the morning and got them out of bed, when I knew 
they missed their home country, their family. </p>
<p>I know I can leave this habit behind me, and I do know 
that I can't do this forever &mdash; the finer, more noble things 
in life now require more of my attention. I watched Steve 
McQueen's film "<i>Shame</i>" the other day and started sobbing 
uncontrollably as everything Michael Fassbender's character 
went through was instantly recognizable and relatable to me.</p>

<h3>weddings</h3>
<b><h2>What does it feel like to cancel your 
wedding?</h2>
Anon User</b><br/>
I met Stephen when I was at University. A few years older 
than myself, he was a junior doctor at the local hospital 
(friend of a friend type thing).
<p>I was bowled over by what I thought was his charm and 
sophistication; I later came to realize that he was manipulative and cold but more of that later.</p>
<p>He had a relatively privileged upbringing as the only child 
of older parents who made sacrifices (enormous sacrifices, really), whilst I was the younger of two children in a family 
where my dad had made a reasonable amount of money from 
his own business.</p>
<p>I was somewhat naive and thought he was 'so special' 
when I saw him in his open top sports car. He did all of the 
things that I thought of as 'exotic' (windsurfing, skiing, flying 
lessons) and he seemed to have an aura around him that attracted a circle of followers.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, he turned his attention to me. 
In hindsight, I wonder if it coincided with me arriving at a 
cricket match with my brother in a (borrowed) Porsche.</p>
<p>I was wooed in classic fashion, flowers, poems, grand romantic gestures etc. You name it, he did it. I can't begin to 
explain how flattering it was.</p>
<p>He asked me to marry him after three months; he telephoned my dad to ask for his permission. Some friends 
thought I was mad, but I told them that he was the love of 
my life. It was only later I learnt that he had asked my dad 
for money towards the engagement ring because I wanted an 
expensive one (this wasn't true and he certainly didn't spend 
the amount he had 'borrowed').</p>
<p>The wedding was booked for the following September, 
again hindsight would suggest an undue haste.<br/>
only the best was good enough for Stephen; my parents 
had suggested a local hotel, but he pushed for a five star hotel 
in a stately home. The guest list grew and grew, two hundred 
guests to a four course meal after the wedding, with another 
three hundred in the evening.<br/>
A string quartet, a live band, a photographer from London because anybody local was too 'provincial' for him. I was 
complicit in all of this, swept along in the 'excitement.'<br/>
of course, my dad was picking up the bill for all of this. 
And 'all of this' was (grotesquely) expensive. The meal alone 
was just over &pound;100 per head. The champagne had to be vintage, the flowers needed to be 'better than anyone else's.'<br/>
I started to feel uneasy about four months before the 'big 
day.' There was nothing specific, but I started to have doubts 
about him.<br/>
We had been to collect his new car from the garage, and 
I saw the way he spoke to the salesman and I felt shame. This 
was particularly relevant to me because my dad was 'a used 
car salesman' as Stephen put it! The fact that my dad owned 
several garages that were successful and the fact that my dad 
was paying for everything didn't seem to occur to him.<br/>
My uneasiness and unhappiness grew, I lost weight (a lot 
of it), I didn't sleep; I was drinking more than I should.<br/>
I finally made my decision three days (yes, three days) before the wedding. I told my dad first.<br/>
You need to know my dad was from working class stock, 
self-made man, down to earth etc he looked me up and down, 
touched my hair, hugged me, and said, "Better now than afterwards."<br/>
If only my mum had been so understanding. She said I 
had 'brought shame on the family!' <br/>
I told Stephen, he looked at me coldly and said I had 'humiliated' him. Which I had probably, but never once did he 
tell me he loved me, he didn't cry (like I was doing).<br/>
The next couple of days passed in a blur, my dad's secretary 
(Janet &mdash; I'll love her forever) took over cancelling everything.<br/>
My mum didn't speak to me. At all. My dad gave me some 
cash, and my brother drove me to a rented cottage in Devon, 
and I spent a week wandering along the coast, crying.<br/>
My mum didn't speak to me for about three months; even 
now she wears a pinched expression when she looks at me 
sometimes.<br/>
one of my friends told me that she had never liked him; 
she thought he was 'rude with a sense of entitlement.'<br/>
You asked how it felt to cancel a wedding: it felt awful. It 
still feels awful. It isn't about the money, which my dad lost 
(although I feel tremendous guilt), it's about my feelings of 
letting people down.<br/>
I've cried again writing this; I don't know why I got swept 
away by the event . . . the romance of it perhaps.<br/>
I do know that not marrying him was the right decision. 
I just did it too late.</p>

<h3>heroism</h3>
<b><h2>What is the most heroic thing you 
have ever done?</h2>
Drew Young Shin, Cardiology for kids<br/>
I ate a cockroach.</b><br/>
This requires an explanation. 
<p>While a trainee as a pediatric cardiologist during my rotation in the cardiac ICU, I met a stoic twelve-year-old girl 
(her fictitious name will be Tammy) diagnosed with heart 
condition called <b>dilated cardiomyopathy</b>. The heart muscle 
was weakened to the point where it no longer could sustain 
the needs of the body without the support of continuous infusions of powerful medications. There was no other option: she 
needed a heart transplant. She was stuck in the ICU, mostly 
bed-bound, waiting for a new heart. Depending on where 
you are in the United States, the average wait period for a 
matched kid-sized heart to become available for donation is 
five to six months. For many patients, it's simply too long, and 
some die waiting.</p>
<p>When I met Tammy, she was emaciated, weakened, depressed, and well into her third month of hospitalization with 
no word of an available heart. She struggled as an adolescent 
would &mdash; frustrated with life, isolated from her friends, literally 
plugged into pumps and IV bags, and surrounded by rotating 
physicians and probing medical students. I couldn't help but 
to notice that her room was her metaphorical aquarium, cage, 
even prison cell. Passerby ICU staff would constantly walk by, 
some would take the time to peer in, a minority would walk 
in, but mostly to examine her or drop off her meals. I overheard a cardiology fellow joke to another, referring to Tammy 
as the "mascot" of the cardiac ICU given her extensive length 
of hospitalization. I'm not entirely sure she didn't overhear it 
as well. Her view from inside to outside must have solidified 
the feeling: healthy people laughing, interacting, going home 
to family and friends. </p>
<p>Tammy's response was to be severely withdrawn. emotionally shutdown. <br/>
When I was assigned to her, I tried to connect with her, 
but could not get any traction. I was nervous as a new trainee, 
and my goal really was not to screw up her medical treatment plan. But recognizing her depression, I did consult child 
psychiatry to help her during this time. I stopped by her bedside multiple times throughout the day to chat, specifically 
avoiding medical jargon. During the first few weeks, I ended 
up mostly speaking to her mother, as she stayed withdrawn. 
After some time, through subtle probing, I discovered one of 
her favorite TV shows was "Fear Factor" &mdash; a reality based 
TV show that puts contestants through extreme challenges. I 
started watching the show so that we had something in common to talk about. <br/>
I had the idea to bring "Fear Factor" to the Cardiac ICU. <br/>
After convincing several of my colleagues, nurses and 
even the ICU attending to participate, we set up daily challenges for the medical staff to go through, very much in a 
Fear Factor manner. Wheelchair races, who-would-toleratethe-biggest-IV-needle, etc. I could tell Tammy was instantly 
interested. She looked forward to the next challenges. My 
challenges for her were mostly physical (as a secret agenda 
to get her rehabilitated: transplant recipients do far better 
when they are better conditioned). Her interest grew, and she 
started coming up with challenges of her own. "Put an nG 
tube in your nose!" (she had one), "Drink the nasty Colace!" 
(she had to, too). Her mother commented to me that for the 
first time in a long time, she's smiling. <br/>
It was a fateful Saturday morning, when I came in for my 
call, I found both Tammy and her mother sporting an evil 
grin. They had procured a cockroach to ingest as the next 
challenge. everyone instantly refused to partake in this one. 
So did I. Towards the afternoon, it looked like this challenge 
was going to be a bust. Tammy was by nature a stoic girl, 
but I could tell she was more than disappointed. Fearing we 
would lose the momentum of her new found spirit for life, I 
mustered up the stomach to entertain the notion. I looked at 
the dead ghastly thing with as much of a poker face as I could 
gather. When I said I would try, Tammy giggled with so much 
delight that I knew there was no turning back. I could not 
break her already broken heart. <br/>
I'll spare you the details of the act itself, but I could see 
a look of gleeful horror yet immense satisfaction on her face 
while I was holding my nose and chewing. She clapped with 
vigor after the unimaginable deed was done. The nurses 
looked at me with disgust. My colleagues avoided me. But I 
had the joy of that girl for a few minutes, and it was worth 
it. That evening, when I was rounding, she was getting ready 
for bed. I checked in on her vitals and all was stable. I said 
goodnight, to which she replied, "Thank you for today." For 
some reason, the way she said it completely warmed my heart. <br/>
early next morning, our team received a call that a heart 
was available. She received a heart transplant that very day. 
She sailed through her operation and was discharged to the 
ward then home shortly thereafter. A few weeks later, I received a photo from her in her Tae Kwon Do uniform &mdash; noticeably fuller than her previous emaciated self and . . . healthy. 
In her note, she said "Thanks for being my hero." <br/>
Her clinical course was marred with complications and 
near death experiences. At one point, I was performing CPR 
on her. A second time, I electrically shocked her for a malignant arrhythmia &mdash; both times averting certain death. But I 
am confident that her hero reference had nothing to do with 
that. It was all simply because I ate a goddamn cockroach. 
But it changed my perspective on what it means to "care" for 
a patient and how to have a meaningful impact as a physician.</p>
