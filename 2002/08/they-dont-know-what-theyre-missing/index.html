<div class="e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m pissed off.</p>
<p>Today I went to Ortigas for a job interview with a nameless IT company where my cousin Rachel works. I was quite optimistic too — the position was for a &ldquo;Java Trainee.&rdquo; I was more than willing to be trained, and a trainee position meant you didn&rsquo;t have to be proficient in Java right? Turns out I was wrong. =( Apparently they needed someone with some experience in Java, preferably with a project or two under his belt. I tried to convince the interviewer that I had a lot of raw talent and learn pretty fast anyway, but I haven&rsquo;t got any high hopes. That pissed me off.</p>
<p>Even worse, I had gone to Ortigas with just enough cash to make the trip back and forth. I had left a good two hundred bucks at home ‘coz I forgot to pick &lsquo;em up and put &lsquo;em in my wallet. I was thinking of trying out the arcade version of Capcom vs SNK 2, maybe buying a CD or two. But no! Now I couldn&rsquo;t even grab a bite on the way home. That pissed me off.</p>
<p>Later that night, my mother was watching &ldquo;While You Were Sleeping&rdquo;, and I was feeling so depressed I was wondering what would happen if I ended up like Sandra Bullock at the start of the movie — alone, and working a dead end job as a ticket seller. Sigh</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the fact that I&rsquo;m still unemployed — it&rsquo;s been a good nine months now and I&rsquo;ve kinda gotten used to that. It&rsquo;s the realization that despite whatever work I&rsquo;ve done in school, I can&rsquo;t get a job. It&rsquo;s as if everything I learned in college was useless.</p>
<p>When I was finishing up in UP, everything seemed simple — I&rsquo;d graduate and all my troubles would be over. I&rsquo;d get a job at maybe Canon or Intel, save a bit, buy a new computer and a PS2, et cetera. To tell the truth I was probably spoiled by those teachers that kept telling us that simply being graduates of the State University was good enough to land a job. I ought to sue those teachers for mental anguish or something. I graduated from one of the hardest course at one of the best universities in the country, and I can&rsquo;t land a job. Gosh darn it all.</p>
<p>After thinking about this, I thought I&rsquo;d evaluate my own skills to see what could be done. Lemme see, I can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded software. Since I did two thesis-level projects involving embedded software, I reckon I&rsquo;m fairly good at this. The problem is that I&rsquo;ve only come across one job opportunity where this skill would be useful, and I never got a callback (and I thought it was a pretty good job for me too.)</li>
<li>Programming. This would be great, until I acknowledge that while I&rsquo;m a programming genius, I don&rsquo;t actually have any application-level programming experience under my belt. I&rsquo;m good a coding, optimizing programs, finding solutions to tough problems, but I&rsquo;ve never been part of a large-scale software project, even though I could probably do it all myself, in theory.</li>
<li>Web Development. I know HTML and various scripting languages, can use Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash, what can&rsquo;t I do? The problem comes up again: I know it all in theory, but lack the experience. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m churning out webpages at a dime a dozen, and most places looking for web developers ask for some level of experience. Curses.</li>
<li>Write. Or at least I like to think I can. But it doesn&rsquo;t sound very profitable to be writing for a living&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Sigh, that&rsquo;s it. Pretty sad, huh? The main problem seems to be most of what I can do is self-taught and relies on my raw talent instead of actual experience. What is it with the world? Why can&rsquo;t they just recognize my genius and overlook my lack of experience? I learn impossibly fast anyway, anything I don&rsquo;t know I can pick up quickly. Argh.</p>
<p>Oh well, at least now I feel better, having put my thoughts into words. This journal thing is probably really healthy for me. I get to whine without burdening anyone with my problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some hope, at least. Sir Louie, the ECE guy Tito Ferry set me up with, said he&rsquo;d ask around, although he did recommend I learn a few more skills by taking some short courses at APC, an IT school near SM North. I&rsquo;m a bit hesistant about that though — short courses will undoubtedly cost money, and I don&rsquo;t want to bother my parents about cash any more than I have to. It&rsquo;s bad enough I can&rsquo;t help them make ends meet&hellip;</p>
<p>Anything else? Lately we&rsquo;ve been watching Excel Saga (ridiculosuly funny! Pedro!!!) and Scryed. AXN is showing two new anime series: Ayashi no Ceres and Gensomaden Saiyuki. And they brought back Monday night anime, so more anime all around. Oh yeah, the A/V cable for our PSX is apparently busted. Which probably explains why I got rather pissed off today. Just when I was gonna get adult Rei back into the party! Without the PSX to distract me, I had no choice but to face my real-world problems</p>
<p>=(</p>
<p>In any case, I guess I have no choice but to keep going and hope for the best. I got a nice quote today from <em>Castaway</em>, from Tom Hanks of all people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I know now I have to keep on breathing. Because the sun will rise tomorrow, and you never know what the tide will bring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
