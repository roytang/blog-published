<hr>
<p>Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up these defenses, you build this whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life. You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They do something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own any more. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.</p>

<p>But of all these friends and lovers</p>
<p>There is no one compares with you.</p>
<p>And these memories lose their meaning</p>
<p>When I think of love as something new.</p>
<p>Though I know I'll never lose affection</p>
<p>For people and things that went before</p>
<p>I know I'll often stop and think about them</p>

<hr>
<p>&quot;So, what's your New Year's resolution?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I resolve to live life on purpose, to take control of my fate, to seize each day as if it were my last. I will be reckless. I will be daring. I will be strong. I will challenge fate. I will defy the gods. Or I will die trying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&hellip;Why can't you just quit smoking or go on a diet like ordinary people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's like you don't know me at all. Life is too short to be ordinary.&quot;</p>

<p>The expense of spirit in a waste of shame</p>
<p>Is lust in action; and till action, lust</p>
<p>Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,</p>

<p>Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,</p>
<p>Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,</p>
<p>On purpose laid to make the taker mad:</p>
<p>Mad in pursuit, and in possession so;</p>
<p>Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;</p>
<p>A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;</p>
<p>Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.</p>
<p>All this the world well knows; yet none knows well</p>
<p>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</p>
