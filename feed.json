Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, it turns out I don\u0026rsquo;t actually have very spoiler-y stuff to say though; the film is pretty straightforward. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll try. It\u0026rsquo;s a marked improvement over the 2016 film in all aspects. It\u0026rsquo;s also visually a feast; James Gunn obviously had way too much fun with many of the shots. I am less a fan of the music/soundtrack choices here than in Guardians of the Galaxy though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the DC characters here are very strange choices, but most of them are used well. At least, the ones that survived most of the movie are pretty good. The rest were mostly cannon fodder who got killed off in like the first 5 minutes. King Shark was hilarious; Bloodshot and Peacemaker\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;rivalry\u0026rdquo; was great; you find yourself strangely rooting for Polka Dot Man; and Ratcatcher 2 was indeed the heart of this film, as promised. Also, I like how they straight-up just played Starro true to his comic book roots, and he\u0026rsquo;s just a giant kaiju starfish. He even walks around like Patrick Starr lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am disappointed at how much the trailers have spoiled though. Specifically thinking of that scene where they\u0026rsquo;re about to go rescue Harley but she just shows up outside and are all \u0026ldquo;What are you guys doing?\u0026rdquo;, that would have been a great gag on first watch. Also I would\u0026rsquo;ve led with that scene first before cutting to \u0026ldquo;X minutes earlier\u0026rdquo; and THEN show Harley tearing her way through the building to escape. I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t like the \u0026ldquo;Harley getting captured\u0026rdquo; subplot too much though, as it felt like unnecessary filler that was added just because they needed to give one of the big stars more to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill overall pretty good, and a welcome entry to the DCEU.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Basically a documentation of thought processes. More often than not the beneficiary of that documentation is myself, or at least, a future version of me; but having a blog also gives other people insight to what and how I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: I read \u003ca href=\"https://jamierubin.net/2021/08/04/unposted-writings/\"\u003ethis post from Jamie Rubin about unposted writings\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore a post goes into the world, there is really only one person who can judge whether it is good enough to be posted and that is me. This blog is a one-man operation. I play the role of writer, editor, and marketing department all by myself. And sometimes I write something and think, nope, that just isn’t very good. It used to be that I’d post the bad stuff anyway, but over time I realized that I wanted to show the very best of what I write. So I’ve gotten better at weeding out the bad stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I found it interesting because it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite of how I approach things. Generally if some thread of thought surfaces in my brain that I feel is good enough to at least start writing a post about, I\u0026rsquo;m going to write it out and probably publish it, even if the end result is not super coherent. It\u0026rsquo;s part of my blogging process being mostly unfiltered - you kind of get the bad with the good here. It\u0026rsquo;s part of an evolving thought process: if ever I decide to revisit the topic in the future, I have this reference for my thoughts on it at the time and see how my views and opinions may have changed or become clearer or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow you blog is of course a mostly personal affair. What topics you discuss, what quality of writing you expect from yourself, these are all personal decisions, and what works for some people may not work for others. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect other people to blog the same way I do; it\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m a wildly successful blogger worth emulating, but I think my methods generally work for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do find that recently my standard for \u0026ldquo;what deserves a blog post\u0026rdquo; has gotten a bit too high though, as I am blogging less and mostly reliant on the \u003ca href=\"/tags/weeknotes\"\u003eweeknotes\u003c/a\u003e to document my thoughts, and I may be leaving too much on the table, leaving quick thoughts mostly to social media or the \u003ca href=\"/notes\"\u003enotes\u003c/a\u003e folder. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of tempted a bit to lean in towards blogging more like I did in the early days before social media, with shorter, more frequent posts. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eBond film no. 22, Daniel Craig\u0026rsquo;s second outing. I actually \u003ca href=\"/2008/11/996918103/\"\u003ewatched this back in 2008\u003c/a\u003e, but apparently I wasn\u0026rsquo;t super impressed (and I wish I wrote more back then lol). I suspect I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like it because this movie is actually a direct sequel to \u003ca href=\"/2021/07/reviews-casino-gunpowder-halloween-masters/\"\u003eCasino Royale\u003c/a\u003e which I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen until this year. It picks up on several hanging plot threads, and some of the characters appear again, and Bond in this film is primarily motivated by anger over the events of the previous film. Not to mention I had only seen two Brosnan movies prior to watching Quantum of Solace at that time, so I really didn\u0026rsquo;t have either the franchise foundation or the context from Casino Royale to appreciate this film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis film sets up more of the gritty tone for modern Bond. Unlike the black and white factions of the cold war, the geopolitical setup here is more complicated, with even Bond\u0026rsquo;s traditional allies the CIA mostly turning against him. The villain\u0026rsquo;s plot and motivations seem kind of thin and the plot itself is a bit forgettable; while I recall many of the scenes from my previous watching, I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember what the overall plot was until it just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlga Kurylenko gave a great performance here. The film also has some great action sequences, and even hits the trifecta of land, sea, and air chases/vehicle fights. The theme song here is \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;Another Way to Die\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e by Alicia Keys and Jack White (of the White Stripes), which was ok but I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly enjoy. Stana Katic makes a bit appearance here towards the end, before her run on \u003cstrong\u003eCastle\u003c/strong\u003e. Also I just chuckle to myself whenever Bond tries to use a 2008-era dumbphone like it was a modern smartphone, such as taking pictures good enough for facial recognition from like a hundred feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the movie is a decent watch. Overall I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying modern Bond, but I have to admit I kind of miss the campy tropes of classic Bond, but I can understand why they\u0026rsquo;d have no place in a modern action franchise. I mean, Craig still hasn\u0026rsquo;t even got a Q or any fancy devices! (Yes, I know he gets a new Q eventually). Anyway, next is Skyfall!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Basically their politics are performative, they act a certain way in public to appeal to their bases, but in private they don\u0026rsquo;t actually really believe in many of the things they say in public. It speaks to a certain lack of integrity and deceptiveness. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of \u003ca href=\"/2016/09/lying-and-salesmanship/\"\u003elaying and salesmanship\u003c/a\u003e that I really dislike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading this article reminded me of supporters praising Duterte back during the 2016 campaign (or even until now) because he is a \u003cem\u003etotoong tao\u003c/em\u003e (i.e. an authentic person). I guess it\u0026rsquo;s kind of appealing to people who are sick and tired of two-faced performative politics, such that they applaud his \u0026ldquo;authenticity\u0026rdquo; even when he says terrible things in public. It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing for people who support Trump because he \u0026ldquo;tells it like it is\u0026rdquo;, I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a weird kind of \u0026ldquo;authenticity\u0026rdquo; because Duterte is actually two-faced in public as well. There\u0026rsquo;s his formal \u0026ldquo;good Duterte\u0026rdquo; version where he pays lip service to human rights and being a decent human being, then there\u0026rsquo;s his ranting extemporaneous vindictive mode where he\u0026rsquo;s cussing everybody, making misogynistic jokes, threatening and/or admitting murder or other crimes, etc. I agree that this is probably \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; to who he is in real life, as in, he is probably two-faced in real life as well, saying what he thinks his current audience wants to hear. I assume Trump is the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think their supporters think their being two-faced in public is \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; because they assume people/politicians are naturally like this and people like Duterte are just showing their true selves in public. At the same time other politicians who always present in public as \u0026ldquo;decent\u0026rdquo; (a term that one would assume to be universally accepted as positive, but has been degraded by negative propaganda) are rejected as \u0026ldquo;plastic\u0026rdquo; because people assume they just behave just as badly as Duterte in person/private? It\u0026rsquo;s like they don\u0026rsquo;t believe good people can exist. This is my same reaction whenever someone is criticized for \u0026ldquo;virtue signaling\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a similar thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at politicians like the Vice-President Leni Robredo, whose public image is generally both decent and competent and may or may not run for President next year, with cautious optimism. We can\u0026rsquo;t really know what public personalities are like in person since we aren\u0026rsquo;t in their inner circles, but I think in generally, we should at least prefer politicians with good public images, instead of praising someone who behaves badly in public as \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo;. After all, no matter how they behave in private, it\u0026rsquo;s their public actions and statements that are more likely to affect society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Obviously, I don\u0026rsquo;t approve of presenting as good/decent to hide bad/illegal activities, but absent such problems, I think it\u0026rsquo;s fine to be cautiously optimistic about people\u0026rsquo;s good nature.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis felt a bit ranty.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSome stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve watched lately. Spoilers for Gunpowder Milkshake and MotU: Revelation are marked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"casino-royale-2006\"\u003eCasino Royale (2006)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond film no. 21, and the first for Daniel Craig. The final era in this James Bond run, looking forward to it. Casino Royale is new to me, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen two of Craig\u0026rsquo;s Bond films, so I have an idea of what to expect: a more serious and much less campy James Bond, grim and determined. The tone here is much closer to Dalton\u0026rsquo;s two films than any of the other runs. Since it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a reboot, it takes place early in Bond\u0026rsquo;s career, in fact he earns his double-O status right in the cold open. Craig\u0026rsquo;s Bond is younger, brasher, more vulnerable, and a bit more prone to mistakes, like letting himself getting caught on camera assassinating a prisoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme song here is \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnzgdBAKyJo\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;You Know My Name\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e by Chris Cornell of SoundGarden fame. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit more alternative than recent theme songs; I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudi Dench is back as M, the only actor carried over from previous incarnations. We don\u0026rsquo;t get any of the usual support staff like Moneypenny or Q. Bond spends most of the first half of the film alone in the field, and the second half supported by treasury agent Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green). Mads Mikkelsen plays the protagonist, terrorist financier Le Chiffre, who Bond challenges to a high-stakes poker game at the titular Casino Royale. Also making an appearance is an old Bond ally, CIA\u0026rsquo;s Felix Leiter, who we last saw mauled by a shark in Dalton\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"/2021/07/4e93006d466cb2f6a53325cba8e27b63/\"\u003eLicense to Kill\u003c/a\u003e. (He has been recast as a black man for the modern age of James Bond.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot is reasonable and action-packed. Daniel Craig probably feels the least \u0026ldquo;Bond-like\u0026rdquo; compared to what his predecessors have established for the role, but his Bond is pretty good and is portrayed as relentless and unstoppable, in spite of his mistakes. The on-foot chase scene in Madagascar near the start of the film is great, especially all the crane shots. Le Chiffre seems a bit incompetent for a villain. The final third of the movie (after the poker game) plays out a bit strangely, for a while I was like \u0026ldquo;What the heck is going on?\u0026rdquo; There is a betrayal in the end that I didn\u0026rsquo;t see coming, which erased any doubt in my mind whether I had actually watched this one in the theaters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking forward to the rest of Craig\u0026rsquo;s run!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gunpowder-milkshake-2021\"\u003eGunpowder Milkshake (2021)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched this during our Saturday online gaming session watch-along. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have high expectations for the film, as I thought it was kind of an ultraviolent grim John-Wick style thing and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really think Karen Gillan and Lena Headey would be good to lead that kind of movie. It does turn out to be ultraviolent, but not super grim, and in fact maybe even a little goofy. There are some great action sequences and fight scenes here, but as soon as I saw that \n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    Karen Gillan was going to have a fight scene in the doctor\u0026rsquo;s office with her arms all floppy from anesthesia\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n, I was like, ok this movie is already worth watching. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a very deep, complicated plot or anything, but overall a decent popcorn watch. A fun, ultraviolent, very bloody, very much not for kids movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"batman-the-long-halloween-2021\"\u003eBatman: The Long Halloween (2021)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a 2-part entry to the DC Universe animated movie line, an adaptation of the famous comic of the same name by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. The story covers an early year of Batman\u0026rsquo;s career as he works with Captain Jim Gordon and then-district attorney Harvey Dent to face both the Gotham mob and a serial killer that kills once a month, on the holidays. The film mostly covers the same story beats as the comic (which I had to review because it\u0026rsquo;s been probably more than a decade since I read it!), with a bit of a twist towards the end of the first part that changes the eventual ending in the second part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t help but compare this storyline to \u003ca href=\"/2008/07/movies-the-dark-knight/\"\u003eThe Dark Knight (2008)\u003c/a\u003e as it covers some of the same elements: organized crime in Gotham and the origin of Two-Face among others. In fact I believe the comic book was one of the inspirations for Nolan\u0026rsquo;s eventual plot for TDK. I would guess that TDK changes were largely due to the need to focus on The Joker, who is more of a minor villain The Long Halloween, and I can\u0026rsquo;t help but imagine what if Nolan had chosen to stay more faithful to TLH storyline, what kind of movie could we have gotten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this particular animated version is pretty good, mostly faithful to the source material, and I like the animation style here. Jensen Ackles is a serviceable Batman voice, and Troy Baker is a pretty good Joker; for a moment I wondered if it was Mark Hamill in the role. Part one was released back in June, and part two just last week, so I only watched both parts today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the next DCU animated movie project is \u003cstrong\u003eInjustice\u003c/strong\u003e, based on the game series of the same name, also looking forward to that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"masters-of-the-universe-revelation-season-1-part-1\"\u003eMasters of the Universe: Revelation (season 1 part 1)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also watched this during Saturday\u0026rsquo;s watch-along. This one is a bit controversial, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about it even though technically the season is only halfway through. The controversy is because the show\u0026rsquo;s plot mostly focuses around Teela and a quest she undergoes after the events of the first episode: \n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    He-Man and Skeletor are presumed dead in a battle and Teela leaves the service of King Randor out of anger over having Adam\u0026rsquo;s secret withheld from her for so long.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice work is pretty good; we immediately recognized Lena Headey\u0026rsquo;s voice as Evil-Lyn, and Mark Hamill as Skeletor is unmistakeable. We didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize Sarah Michelle Gellar as Teela though! The storyline so far is okay, though not super original. It kind of felt like a typical JRPG party-gathering and going on a quest thing, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of old fans didn\u0026rsquo;t like the focus being taken away from He-Man and focusing on a female character, which many imagined as purely a diversity play. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s much too early to judge the season overall, since it\u0026rsquo;s only halfway through, but even then, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong about focusing on some other characters, as the show is explicitly titled \u0026ldquo;Masters of the Universe\u0026rdquo; without the \u0026ldquo;He-Man and the\u0026hellip; \u0026quot; prefix. It\u0026rsquo;s probably best to see where Kevin Smith takes us for the eventual second part (for which we have no release date yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n",
