It was maybe something you could have predicted if you had paid attention to all the little details about the people and their personalities and the actual deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not a long book. I finished the book in 4 sittings, with the last sitting covering the last half of the book; this is a typical speed for me once a book really gets going, I\u0026rsquo;ll have a hard time putting it down until I\u0026rsquo;m done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m enjoying these mysteries, and I find that it\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really read these kinds of mystery novels before. I\u0026rsquo;ve read stuff when I was younger like the Encyclopedia Brown stuff where you\u0026rsquo;re challenged to solve the mystery, etc, but no real mystery novels like this I think.
