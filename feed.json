            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve not read any Agatha Chrstie, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d rectify that by getting into the Hercule Poirot series of books. To start off I chose \u003cem\u003eMurder on the Orient Express\u003c/em\u003e because \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/watching-lately-jun-jul-2019/\"\u003eI watched the 2017 movie a couple of years ago\u003c/a\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDeath on the Nile\u003c/em\u003e because it has a movie coming out next year. I figure it would be a good contrast of movie-first vs book first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTook me a bit under a week of leisurely reading to finish \u003cem\u003eMurder on the Orient Express\u003c/em\u003e. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in a rush since I already knew how the mystery turns out. The book wasn\u0026rsquo;t very long, but it was very well structured. A couple of chapters of setup before the crime itself happened, then a chapter each for Poirot to interrogate each of the suspects and then a few more chapters to piece everything together. The book pretty much followed the movie closely, though I think they changed some of the character details for the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDeath on the Nile\u003c/em\u003e had a much different pace, although it\u0026rsquo;s about as short as the first one. It feels like the author spent longer on setup, introducing the different characters even before they met Poirot on the trip to the titular Nile. (As opposed to \u003cem\u003eOrient Express\u003c/em\u003e where the entire book narrated only scenes where Poirot was present.) I finished the book in three days; the last day I binged through the last 2/3 of the book once the crime finally happened. It helped that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know the eventual solution (though I had a hunch on who the culprit(s) might be, and the hunch eventually turned out correct), so I was eager to get to the end. I feel like this book gave a better preview of Poriot\u0026rsquo;s investigative abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find myself enjoying the author\u0026rsquo;s writing; the books aren\u0026rsquo;t overly long, and each chapter is usually straightforward, with scenes depicting things that are either red herrings or eventually leading up to the final mystery solution. The books seem like light, leisurely reading, unlike the sci-fi / fantasy epics I\u0026rsquo;m used to. The best comparison I have is to \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/hardy-boys/\"\u003ethe Hardy Boys series\u003c/a\u003e although this series is of course way less juvenile. I can easily send myself reading through a few more of these Poirot books throughout the year. (I didn\u0026rsquo;t follow any recommended reading order, but the books are largely self-contained anyway\u0026hellip; though I know \u003cem\u003eNile\u003c/em\u003e happens after \u003cem\u003eOrient Express\u003c/em\u003e because Poirot references the prior case.) I should also probably try out some of the author\u0026rsquo;s non-Poirot books as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not big on modern frontend JavaScript frameworks (mostly because I think web pages should use as little JS as possible), but when I do find the need to use one, my weapon of choice is \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/\"\u003eVue.js\u003c/a\u003e. I dislike React, but mostly because (a) my first experience with React was with mobile development using React Native for \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/mobile-app-dev/\"\u003emobile app development\u003c/a\u003e, which I generally don\u0026rsquo;t like; and (b) I don\u0026rsquo;t like Facebook, which backs React. I have no opinion on Angular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being my frontend framework of choice, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually have that much experience with Vue beyond a few small projects each with a minimal number of screens / pages. That being said, I do have some thoughts, coming mostly from the POV of a developer \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003emore used to the old-school ways of Javascript and web development in general\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entry point of course, is the \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/\"\u003egetting started guide on the Vue website itself\u003c/a\u003e, which walks you through most of the framework features. I have no concern about most of these; the features are explained well and I find most of the documentation quite good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy issue is with how the site recommends to beginners to set up their Vue projects: via a script include from a CDN. When I first saw this guide, I assumed this was the standard, recommended way to build a Vue project, so this was how I did it for my first small project, a small demo site I needed to produce in a few days. Due to the short timeframe, I had decided to learn as I go. The component registration section of the guide also gives no guidance or recommendation on how to structure your components or projects, so I ended up with most of the components set up in a single JS file. (Admittedly, as a person with more than a decade of web dev experience, I should have at least split it up into several files, but time was short.) A technical person reviewing the code commented that I had implemented the frontend \u0026ldquo;in a very strange manner\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gets worse when you try to install third-party components, which is a big feature of the ecosystem of these frontend frameworks. In my experience, most third-party components will only give instructions for installation via \u003ccode\u003enpm\u003c/code\u003e and a JS module system, neither of which are covered nor recommended by the beginner sections of the guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few projects later, and I now know that I vastly prefer developing Vue projects as Node projects built using the scaffolding provided by \u003ca href=\"https://cli.vuejs.org/\"\u003eVue CLI\u003c/a\u003e, with the components implemented as standalone \u003ccode\u003e.vue\u003c/code\u003e files. The usage of these tools and methods are covered in the \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html\"\u003eInstallation section of the guide\u003c/a\u003e (which the \u0026ldquo;Get Started\u0026rdquo; link skips over) and the \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html\"\u003eSingle File Components section under the Tooling section\u003c/a\u003e (which seemed like an advanced section a beginner is not likely to get into.) This method also makes installing third-party components much more straightforward. It\u0026rsquo;s not even necessary to cover what tools like Webpack or Babel are doing, since those are largely abstracted away by the scaffolding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically my main complaint is that the guide doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job of transitioning from the introducing the beginner to the language specifics to introducing a recommended approach and tools for organizing more intermediate or complex projects. The method of using a script include seems suitable for little more than a single-page todo list webapp. I suppose the perceived shortcoming might be attributed to my background at least partially - I still tend to think like a developer using jQuery, and I don\u0026rsquo;t default to thinking about Node applications when doing webapps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I am overall happy with Vue.js and it\u0026rsquo;s still my choice of frontend framework moving forward (should a frontend framework even be needed!) Although, maybe I should at least consider trying out / evaluating Angular so I can pretend to make a fair comparison?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

After that, I decided to delve into some Agatha Christie.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHad quiz night last night, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t do particularly well, about the same as the previous week. There is another online quiz night announced and scheduled for next week, by a different group, with topics that we like, but we are hesitant because they have an increased entry fee which is supposed to contribute to a prize pool. Doing online trivia for charity or just for fun has been okay, but I\u0026rsquo;m not really comfortable competing for cash prizes, given that it\u0026rsquo;s all done online and it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to police whether the participants are googling or have a whole army sitting behind them or such. That\u0026rsquo;s also true even if there weren\u0026rsquo;t a prize, but having the prize just gives a lot more incentive for it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpeaking of trivia for fun, this past week I migrated the \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003etriviastorm\u003c/a\u003e site back-end code in order to merge it with this site\u0026rsquo;s backend. The motivation for this was to resolve some memory issues on my cheap DigitalOcean droplet; basically running two Django instances meant I was using twice as much memory as necessary. After merging the backends, I replaced the front end of the triviastorm site with a new VueJS-based static site. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write a blog post about VueJS as well, and dipping my toes into it again helped me solidify some thoughts, will probably do sometimes this coming week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-coming-week\"\u003eThis coming week:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eModern Horizons 2 spoilers (not that I expect to be playing Modern any time soon)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

The one aircon we have in the house has been busted all summer, so we have been suffering through the heat and surviving mostly through stacking multiple fans and also an excessive number of showers.",
