The central idea was \u0026ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.\u0026rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGovernment critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They\u0026rsquo;re not wrong.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePredictably, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912\"\u003ethe police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links\u003c/a\u003e. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHowever, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later \u003ca href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan\"\u003eapologized\u003c/a\u003e, but supposedly they \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241\"\u003ewere planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them\u003c/a\u003e. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLast Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin \u003ca href=\"https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story\"\u003equickly issued an apology\u003c/a\u003e and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecently, news broke that the National Security Adviser \u003ca href=\"https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy\"\u003ehad imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProbably one of the reasons we can\u0026rsquo;t have nice things: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771\"\u003epeople can\u0026rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives\u003c/a\u003e.

It stopped being released as a daily a while back, and the author now only releases a new comic every Sunday, I think. Once again, I am following \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/billamend\"\u003ethe artist on twitter\u003c/a\u003e.

It\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://sinfest.net/\"\u003estill running\u003c/a\u003e but I mostly lost interest when he tended to do arcs that ran really long.

I still read the strip, mostly because it comes with our daily newspaper. (On paper! We still have those!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReal life comics\u003c/strong\u003e - this was a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life comic about a guy named Greg. I had stopped following it for a while because of reasons, but last year I found out that (a) it was still going strong; and (b) the author recently \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/reallifecomics/status/1284587454968651777\"\u003ecame out as as trans\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C\u0026amp;H, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to follow it now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsnark\u003c/strong\u003e - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics.

I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly.

Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader).

My thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeason 1 is 10 episodes, each episode 30 minutes long. I finished all of the episodes over the span of one day!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know much coming in: I knew it was about sports, and I knew it was supposedly a comedy. For some reason I assumed it was about American football. It turns out to be about English association football, i.e. soccer!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWikipedia claims the series is a comedy, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a \u0026ldquo;ha-ha / laugh out loud\u0026rdquo; zany situation comedy like say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or Modern Family. Ted Lasso is more of an \u0026ldquo;absurd premise\u0026rdquo; kind of comedy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, helped develop the series, but it is much less zanier than that one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstead, Ted Lasso is the story of an outsider coming into to help a dysfunctional team get their act together. I\u0026rsquo;d say the story it most reminds me of is Mighty Ducks. In both cases, I learned a lot more about the associated sport (Ice hockey / association football) works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe difference between Mighty Ducks\u0026rsquo; reluctant coach Gordon Bombay and the titular Ted Lasso is that Ted is earnest, eager, and genuinely cares for his team, and he uses his abundant optimism to plot through any problems that life throws at him.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe meat of the story is how Ted Lasso, an American football coach thrust into the unfamiliar world of the English Premiere League navigates both the foreign culture and the many contrasting personalities he has to work with.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe main plotline of the team\u0026rsquo;s eventual win-loss record is at many times overshadowed by the character arcs and development, as the cast grows to understand each other and their roles within the team.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI think one of the main reasons Ted Lasso has been so popular during this pandemic is the absolute optimism both of the show and the lead character inspite of all the challenges thrown his way. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of optimism we could all use in these trying times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
