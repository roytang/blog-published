            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back, on a whim I purchased this indie game \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/\"\u003eKnightin\u0026rsquo;\u003c/a\u003e on Steam. I forget how I came across it and why I decided to buy, but no regrets. It\u0026rsquo;s a tightly-focused dungeon crawler in the style of original Legend of Zelda/Link to the Past dungeons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach dungeon is a set of rooms you clear one at a time, until you get  to the dungeon boss and beat him. Clearing rooms involves defeating  enemies, solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles and opening chests. It\u0026rsquo;s a  short game, there are only four dungeons to clear each slightly more difficult than the last. There is no plot at all. The game itself openly admits this by painting the thinnest of flavors. You play Sir Lootalot and you want to beat the evil dark lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. For treasure! No princess to save or anything like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I say \u0026ldquo;tightly-focused\u0026rdquo;, I mean that the game is barebones and does only what it says, but it does it very well. I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of how well-designed it is. It\u0026rsquo;s entirely predictable, you know what you\u0026rsquo;re getting into, but each part is executed really well. Each dungeon consists of multiple floors. Each floor has exactly twelve rooms, arranged in the same 3x4 rectangle shape every time. There\u0026rsquo;s a minimap that never changes shape, but maps room paths as you go. The minimap has a nice notation that indicates things like stairs up, stairs down, a merchant, a warp point, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is simple and straightforward as well. You don\u0026rsquo;t get a plethora of weapons like Link does in the Zelda series. You start out with a sword (obviously) and later you get access to a wand that lets you shoot fireballs, and those are your only weapons ever. Later you also learn to dash (which hits enemies with the sword), fire dash (which leaves a trail of flames as you dash), and learn a spin attack (a la Link to the Past). You only ever have to remember four buttons: swing sword, shoot wand, dash, and raise shield (and I very rarely use the shield).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObstacles in your way include enemies of course, and the difficulty ramp is great here as well. You start out with enemies that just walk around randomly and they damage you if they bump you. As you progress you meet more complicated foes. Enemies with ranged attacks. Enemies that chase you. Enemies that can move faster. Enemies that can pop out from under your feet. Enemies that can reproduce. And so on. They are always introduced one new enemy at a time so you get to know their shtick before you meet them in more difficult rooms. Rooms can also have obstacles, such as blades that suddenly jut out of the ground, rotating saw blades, pillars that shoot projectiles, and so on, all adding to room difficulty. Some rooms will have a merchant who sells stuff (you get gold from enemy drops), or chests you can open. Everything is pre-placed, no procedural generation here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#d621fbf9a9ac70145a465c88aca90db5-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2021/02/game-review-knightin/enemies_hu9d22806621fe1d1ad4285aeb12c27adf_274814_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Later rooms contain multiple enemies of different types and some dungeon mechanisms too.\" title=\"Later rooms contain multiple enemies of different types and some dungeon mechanisms too.\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eLater rooms contain multiple enemies of different types and some dungeon mechanisms too.

I can\u0026rsquo;t personally relate to that, as I have a pretty good relationship with my family. The author\u0026rsquo;s difficult family life provides a window into a kind of human interaction I\u0026rsquo;m not too familiar with.

            "title": "Digital Boardgames Review: Scythe",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy second review is about \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eScythe: Digital Edition\u003c/a\u003e. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has \u0026ldquo;encounters\u0026rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it\u0026rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game\u0026rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven\u0026rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s a \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic\"\u003ecomeback mechanism\u003c/a\u003e we\u0026rsquo;re missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I\u0026rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they\u0026rsquo;re nothing special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as \u0026ldquo;winning by time\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the digital board games we\u0026rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It tells the story of a near-future world and a trend of people going \u0026ldquo;walkaway\u0026rdquo;. This term means walking away from what they call \u0026ldquo;default society\u0026rdquo;, characterized by late stage capitalism, massive inequality, ever-present surveillance, and a world controlled by what they call the zottarich, or simply zottas. Not too far from our own present reality of course. Later, the novel also delves into the near-future (?) concept of humans being to upload their consciousness into machines, effectively allowing them to cheat death by running as a \u0026ldquo;brain in a jar\u0026rdquo; on a cluster of computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing walkaway means giving everything up and deciding to live communally and off the land, as it were. This near-future world makes this possible due to the abundance of materials and equipment that have been left behind or abandoned due to failed cities, institutions or companies. Resources that are presumably being wasted or going unused because of insane things like copyright controls, patents, and so on. Walkaways are shown building entire communities by sending out drones to seek out and gather nearby raw materials and constructing machines like fabricators that can spin out food and clothing, all powered by open source code that is freely shared and improved upon by walkaways worldwide via a highly distributed and decentralized walkaway network. \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; society and media portray walkaways as anarchists and terrorists, living on the fringe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot centers upon a small group of twenty-somethings (including one zotta heiress) who initially flirt with the idea of going walkaway, and then decide to jump right in. Under that thin veneer, the novel feels mostly like an opportunity to explore how such an idea could work, and how it could bridge the gap between our current society and an idealized future, post-scarcity and even post-human. That gap is not bridged easily of course. Discoveries in walkaway culture and science such as human mind uploads threaten to overturn the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; society and thus draws the ire of the zottas, who send in mercenaries and even armies to disrupt, arrest, and take down walkaways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe author is a blogger I\u0026rsquo;ve known about for a while, and his interest in various kinds of technology and possible future applications to help supplant late-stage capitalism are made obvious through the novel. I initially thought it was being a bit too preachy and idealistic about walkaway culture being the right path for humanity. The story argues that there is plenty to go around, and that people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be coerced to work and should have an abundance mentality, freely helping and giving away to others, something that works in the novel because of the existence of fabricators and the apparent abundance of raw materials, but which I am unsure would be true in the real world. This is why we still have a lot of people arguing against things like UBI and so on. The novel anchors itself from a point where the scarcity issue is mostly addressed, what\u0026rsquo;s left is to overcome the regressive \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; capitalist systems holding us back from a brighter future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of find myself aligned with the author in terms of ideology; I am very much hoping we as a society find a way past the perils of capitalism, but I\u0026rsquo;m not yet so optimisci that it could work. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether the story should be classified as a dystopia - it certainly describes a very dystopian status quo, but that status quo is not too far from our current one. And ultimately, despite all the trials and tribulations our walkaway protagonists are subject to, the novel still exudes optimism about humanity\u0026rsquo;s future. So, a hopeful dystopia, a dystopia that can be defeated? A dystopia that is merely a stepping stone towards what the walkaways call \u0026ldquo;the first days of a better nation\u0026quot;\n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
