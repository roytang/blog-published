I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C\u0026amp;H, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to follow it now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsnark\u003c/strong\u003e - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember following it for too long, probably lost interest at some point.

I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly. The site is no longer accessible and he no longer seems to be blogging.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSteve Pavlina\u0026rsquo;s Blog\u003c/strong\u003e - this is a guy who became well-known as a self-help author and motivational speaker. He often wrote about personal development. I\u0026rsquo;m not really into that kind of content anymore so I no longer follow him.

The site is \u003ca href=\"http://www.43folders.com/\"\u003estill around\u003c/a\u003e, but the last update is from 2011. I\u0026rsquo;m currently following \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies\"\u003ethe author on twitter\u003c/a\u003e, he no longer seems to be blogging and is more of a podcaster now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"feed-readers\"\u003efeed readers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the old site, my feeds back then were powered by an app called Bloglines. \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines\"\u003eWikipedia\u003c/a\u003e says Bloglines became unavailable in 2015, but presumably I stopped using it in 2007 when I \u003ca href=\"/2007/01/newshutch-feed-aggregator/\"\u003eswitched to a different app called Newshutch\u003c/a\u003e.

Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader). Feel free to send me blogs or blogrolls you recommend, I will gladly spend an hour or so scrolling through a blogroll and clicking through links and checking out blogs!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA number of people I follow have been raving about Ted Lasso for a while, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d give it a try. My thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeason 1 is 10 episodes, each episode 30 minutes long. I finished all of the episodes over the span of one day!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know much coming in: I knew it was about sports, and I knew it was supposedly a comedy. For some reason I assumed it was about American football. It turns out to be about English association football, i.e. soccer!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWikipedia claims the series is a comedy, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a \u0026ldquo;ha-ha / laugh out loud\u0026rdquo; zany situation comedy like say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or Modern Family. Ted Lasso is more of an \u0026ldquo;absurd premise\u0026rdquo; kind of comedy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, helped develop the series, but it is much less zanier than that one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstead, Ted Lasso is the story of an outsider coming into to help a dysfunctional team get their act together. I\u0026rsquo;d say the story it most reminds me of is Mighty Ducks. In both cases, I learned a lot more about the associated sport (Ice hockey / association football) works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe difference between Mighty Ducks\u0026rsquo; reluctant coach Gordon Bombay and the titular Ted Lasso is that Ted is earnest, eager, and genuinely cares for his team, and he uses his abundant optimism to plot through any problems that life throws at him.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe meat of the story is how Ted Lasso, an American football coach thrust into the unfamiliar world of the English Premiere League navigates both the foreign culture and the many contrasting personalities he has to work with.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe main plotline of the team\u0026rsquo;s eventual win-loss record is at many times overshadowed by the character arcs and development, as the cast grows to understand each other and their roles within the team.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI think one of the main reasons Ted Lasso has been so popular during this pandemic is the absolute optimism both of the show and the lead character inspite of all the challenges thrown his way. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of optimism we could all use in these trying times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

I’m here to tell you that that is not true. Programming is hard, programming is not for everyone, and for the time being everyone might be able to do it, but most definitely most should not. Like most of the empty, shallow, positive messages coming with an automatic defense against refute, in this case talking about this gatekeeping thing that simply doesn’t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think gatekeeping is definitely a thing that happens. I should know, I used to hold the opinion that not everybody can be a programmer, because there are non-trivial skill sets that are necessary, such as attention to detail, ability to analyze and reason out possible outcomes, the ability to imagine abstractions in your head, and so on. Back when I did training for new hires, I could easily tell who are the people who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pass, by simply noting who had trouble with things like SQL joins. (This was back in the day when we expected our devs to be able to handle everything from backend database stuff to web frontends with HTML/CSS/JS. I assume modern day frontend devs wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have much use for SQL usage\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, it\u0026rsquo;s not a hard gate, where someone can tell you it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to become a programmer. Anyone can be a programmer, in the same way that anyone can become an accountant or a lawyer or such: it\u0026rsquo;s going to take a nontrivial amount of effort and hard work (I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming that being a programmer is necessarily as difficult as those jobs!). Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible. And a lot of the time it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to detect whether that aptitude exists until you\u0026rsquo;re trying it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also a huge difference between learning to code just to write a few scripts in Python or some macros in Excel vs working professionally as a programmer, possibly in a team, with serious deadlines and crunch and all that. Not everyone is suited to that life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m all for inclusivity - we definitely need more people working in tech, and for people who are struggling, learning to code may be a way for them to live better lives. But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sugarcoat the challenges involved or the effort required. \u0026ldquo;Anyone can learn to code\u0026rdquo;, given enough time and effort, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean programming is easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
